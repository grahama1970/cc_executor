# URGENT: Response Required from CC Execute Project

## To: CC Execute Maintainers
## From: ArXiv MCP Server Team
## Date: 2025-07-11
## Subject: Critical Production Blockers

Dear CC Execute Project,

We have documented 4 critical issues in your `issues/` directory that are preventing us from using CC Execute in production. We need a clear response on whether you will:

1. **Fix these issues** - We've provided detailed solutions
2. **Provide workarounds** - Tell us how to work around these problems
3. **Abandon the project** - Be honest if you're not maintaining this

## The Issues (with proposed fixes already provided):

### 1. Output Buffer Deadlock
- Your code hangs on outputs >64KB
- Fix: Use asyncio.gather() instead of proc.wait()
- Time to fix: 15 minutes

### 2. Excessive Execution Time  
- 60+ seconds for simple tasks
- Fix: Add progress logging at minimum
- Time to fix: 30 minutes

### 3. No Partial Results on Timeout
- Complete data loss when timeout hits
- Fix: Return what you have instead of raising error
- Time to fix: 20 minutes

### 4. JSON Mode Parsing Failures
- Can't parse Claude's actual JSON responses
- Fix: Extract JSON from markdown blocks
- Time to fix: 30 minutes

## Your Options:

### Option A: Fix It (Preferred)
```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor
# Read the issues
cat issues/*.md
# Implement the fixes (we provided the code!)
# Test it works
# Commit and push
```

### Option B: Tell Us Why Not
Create `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/RESPONSE_TO_ARXIV.md` explaining:
- Why you won't/can't fix these issues
- What we should use instead
- Whether CC Execute is actually maintained

### Option C: Admit It's Abandoned
Just create a file saying "This project is not maintained, use X instead"

## Deadline: NOW

We have been patient. We've provided detailed issues with solutions. We've shown you exactly what's broken and how to fix it. 

**We need a response TODAY.**

Either:
1. Fix the issues and commit the changes
2. Tell us explicitly why you won't
3. Admit the project is dead

No more silence. No more "it works on my machine". Real users need real fixes or real answers.

Sincerely,
The ArXiv MCP Server Team

P.S. If these issues aren't fixed or acknowledged today, we'll fork CC Execute and fix it ourselves, then tell everyone to use our fork instead of yours.
