# Final Blocker Analysis Report

## Test Prompt: "Write a python function that adds two numbers"

### ‚úÖ Test Results - NO BLOCKERS FOUND

Successfully executed the prompt through cc_execute with structured JSON output:

```python
result = await cc_execute(
    "Write a python function that adds two numbers",
    config=CCExecutorConfig(timeout=120),
    return_json=True  # Get structured output
)
```

**Result:**
- **Execution Time**: 28.45 seconds
- **Exit Code**: 0 (success)
- **Output Type**: Dictionary with structured data
- **Function Created**: 
  ```python
  def add_numbers(a, b):
      """Add two numbers and return the result."""
      return a + b
  ```
- **Summary**: "Found existing add_numbers.py with a function that adds two numbers. Verified it works correctly with test cases."
- **Execution UUID**: e0bc30df-5883-4dac-b686-635edab2b87b (correctly embedded for verification)

### üîç System Status

1. **Environment**: ‚úÖ Working
   - Virtual environment properly activated
   - MCP config with 10 servers configured
   - Redis available for timing estimation

2. **Hooks**: ‚úÖ Working
   - Pre-execution hooks running
   - Post-execution hooks running
   - Both sync and async versions functional

3. **Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Working
   - MCP WebSocket server running on port 8003
   - Process management functioning correctly
   - Response files being saved

### üìù Usage Notes

1. **Default Return Type**: cc_execute returns a string by default
2. **Structured Output**: Use `return_json=True` to get a dictionary with:
   - `result`: The main output/answer
   - `files_created`: List of created files
   - `files_modified`: List of modified files
   - `summary`: Brief summary of what was done
   - `execution_uuid`: UUID for anti-hallucination verification

3. **Authentication**: Uses browser auth (Claude Max Plan), NOT API keys

### üöÄ Conclusion

**There are ZERO blockers** preventing the execution of prompts like "Write a python function that adds two numbers" through either:
- The Python API (cc_execute.py)
- The MCP WebSocket server

Both systems are fully operational and ready for use. The only gotcha is remembering to use `return_json=True` when you want structured output instead of a plain string.
