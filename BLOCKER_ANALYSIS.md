# CC Executor Blocker Analysis

## Test Results for: "Write a python function that adds two numbers"

### ‚úÖ What Works

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Virtual environment properly activated
   - MCP config exists with 10 servers configured
   - Redis is available for timing estimation

2. **Execution**
   - Command executed successfully in 15.4 seconds
   - Claude created `add_numbers.py` file
   - Exit code: 0 (success)
   - Response saved to JSON file

3. **Infrastructure**
   - MCP WebSocket server running on port 8003
   - Hooks are properly integrated
   - Process management working correctly

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues (Non-Blockers)

1. **Return Type Inconsistency**
   - `cc_execute()` returns a string (the output) by default
   - To get structured data, need to either:
     - Use `json_mode=True` parameter
     - Parse the saved response file
   - This caused the TypeError in the test script

2. **Missing json_utils Module**
   - Warning: "Could not import json_utils, using basic JSON parsing"
   - Falls back to standard json module (works fine)

3. **No ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**
   - Not needed! Uses browser authentication (Claude Max Plan)
   - This is by design, not a blocker

### ‚ùå Potential Blockers

**NONE IDENTIFIED** - The system works correctly for the test prompt!

The execution completed successfully and Claude created the requested function.

### üìù Correct Usage Examples

#### 1. Basic String Output (Default)
```python
output = await cc_execute("Write a python function that adds two numbers")
print(output)  # String: "Created `add_numbers.py` with..."
```

#### 2. JSON Mode (Structured Output)
```python
result = await cc_execute(
    "Write a python function that adds two numbers",
    json_mode=True
)
print(result["result"])  # The main output
print(result["files_created"])  # List of created files
```

#### 3. Access Full Response Data
```python
# Execute
output = await cc_execute("Write a python function...")

# Read the saved response file
response_files = list(Path("src/cc_executor/client/tmp/responses").glob("*.json"))
latest = max(response_files, key=lambda p: p.stat().st_mtime)
data = json.loads(latest.read_text())

print(data["exit_code"])  # 0
print(data["execution_time"])  # 15.4
```

### üöÄ MCP Usage

For MCP WebSocket usage:
```python
# Use the MCP tools
from src.cc_executor.servers.mcp_cc_execute import execute_with_streaming

result = await execute_with_streaming(
    task="Write a python function that adds two numbers"
)
```

## Conclusion

**There are NO blockers preventing execution of simple prompts.** 

Both cc_execute.py and the MCP WebSocket server can successfully handle prompts like "Write a python function that adds two numbers". The system is fully operational.

The only issue encountered was a usage error in the test script - expecting a dict when cc_execute returns a string by default. This is easily fixed by using `json_mode=True` or parsing the saved response file.
