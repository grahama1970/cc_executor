CC Executor MCP Services. CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS: 1) MCP tools in src/cc_executor/tools/*.py are CLI scripts that parse sys.argv - they CANNOT be imported directly, subprocess execution is REQUIRED not a bug 2) FastMCP has validation bugs with Dict/List parameters - all complex params MUST be JSON strings 3) Breaking changes forbidden - this is used by production Claude Code instances, always maintain backward compatibility with warnings not errors 4) Never create new files with names like tool_optimized.py or tool_refactored.py - modify in place only 5) All MCP tools must return valid JSON even on error - defensive error handling required. DESIGN DECISIONS: Embedded HTML in visualizers is intentional (single file deployment). Default passwords with warnings are intentional (ease of development). Monolithic classes are acceptable if they work reliably. PERFORMANCE: Subprocess overhead is acceptable for reliability. COMPATIBILITY: Must work with uv script execution pattern.
