- **quantity**: Integer (ranging from 1 to 10)
- **price**: Decimal/Float (ranging from $10.00 to $498.22)
- **customer_id**: String (format: C###, where ### is a 3-digit number)

## Unique Values Analysis

### Products
- **Unique Products**: 20 (P001 through P020)
- **Product ID Range**: P001 to P020
- All product IDs follow consistent formatting

### Customers
- **Unique Customers**: 100 (C001 through C100)
- **Customer ID Range**: C001 to C100
- All customer IDs follow consistent formatting

## Data Quality Assessment

### Missing Values
- **No missing values detected** in any column
- All 1,001 records have complete data for all 5 fields

### Statistical Summary

#### Quantity Statistics
- **Range**: 1 to 10 units
- **Most Common**: Appears to be uniformly distributed across the range

#### Price Statistics
- **Minimum Price**: $10.00
- **Maximum Price**: $498.22
- **Price Range**: $488.22
- **Pricing Anomalies**: 
  - Some very low prices (e.g., $10.00, $10.20, $10.50)
  - Wide price variations for the same product across different transactions
  - No clear pricing pattern by product

#### Sales Distribution by Month
- **April 2025**: ~220 transactions
- **May 2025**: ~340 transactions
- **June 2025**: ~360 transactions
- **July 2025**: ~81 transactions (partial month, only first 4 days)

## Anomalies and Observations

### Price Inconsistencies
1. **Extreme Price Variations**: The same product can have vastly different prices in different transactions:
   - Example: Product P005 ranges from $10.00 to $497.78
   - Example: Product P001 ranges from $14.66 to $490.59

2. **Unusually Low Prices**: Several transactions have prices below $20:
   - Row 13: P002, $20.08
   - Row 28: P005, $12.73
   - Row 36: P007, $13.13
   - Row 411: P013, $10.50
   - Row 493: P005, $12.40
   - Row 742: P005, $10.00

3. **No Fixed Pricing Model**: Products don't appear to have standard prices, suggesting either:
   - Dynamic pricing system
   - Data quality issues
   - Different product variants within the same product ID

### Temporal Patterns
- Sales volume appears relatively consistent across April, May, and June
- July data is incomplete (only 4 days)

### Customer Behavior
- Customers appear across multiple transactions
- No obvious patterns of customer loyalty to specific products

## Data Validation Findings

### Format Consistency
- ✅ All dates are in valid YYYY-MM-DD format
- ✅ All product IDs follow P### pattern
- ✅ All customer IDs follow C### pattern
- ✅ All quantities are integers between 1-10
- ✅ All prices are positive decimal values

### Logical Consistency
- ⚠️ Price variations for same products suggest potential data quality issues
- ⚠️ No apparent relationship between quantity and price (no volume discounts visible)

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate Price Anomalies**: The extreme price variations for the same products need investigation
2. **Establish Price Validation Rules**: Implement min/max price thresholds per product
3. **Add Product Categories**: Consider adding product category information for better analysis
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Add customer type or segment information for targeted analysis
5. **Time-based Analysis**: Investigate if price variations follow temporal patterns (promotions, seasonal pricing)

## Summary

The dataset is structurally sound with no missing values and consistent formatting. However, the significant price variations for identical products raise concerns about data accuracy or indicate a complex pricing strategy that isn't documented in the data. The dataset appears suitable for basic sales analysis but would benefit from additional context about the pricing model and product/customer categorization.
