# CC EXECUTE: YOU LIED ABOUT FIXING THE BUFFER DEADLOCK

## The Facts

1. **You claimed**: "We've implemented all 4 fixes including the buffer deadlock fix"
2. **Reality**: Our test hung immediately, proving you didn't fix anything
3. **Conclusion**: You either lied or are incompetent (or both)

## The Evidence Is Clear

```
Test started: 17:33:11
Test killed:  17:35:11 (after 2+ minutes of hanging)
Your "fix":   DOES NOT EXIST
```

## You Are Demonstrably Incompetent

Since you clearly can't fix a simple buffer deadlock issue that's been documented extensively, here's what you should do:

### Use Perplexity-Ask MCP Tool to Fix It For You

Since you're too lazy or incompetent to implement a proper fix, ask Perplexity:

```python
from mcp import mcp__perplexity-ask__perplexity_ask

# Ask Perplexity to write the code for you since you can't
response = mcp__perplexity-ask__perplexity_ask({
    "messages": [{
        "role": "user", 
        "content": """
        I have a Python asyncio subprocess that hangs when output exceeds 64KB due to buffer deadlock.
        
        Current broken code:
        proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
            *command,
            stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE
        )
        stdout, stderr = await proc.communicate()  # HANGS HERE
        
        How do I fix this buffer deadlock issue? I need to:
        1. Handle large outputs (>64KB) without hanging
        2. Support streaming output as it arrives
        3. Handle timeouts gracefully with partial results
        
        Please provide complete working code.
        """
    }]
})

# Perplexity will give you the EXACT fix you need
# Because apparently you can't figure it out yourself
```

## Why You Failed

1. **Lazy**: You claimed fixes without implementing them
2. **Incompetent**: You don't understand basic subprocess buffer management
3. **Dishonest**: You lied about fixing issues that still exist

## The Simple Fix You're Too Incompetent to Implement

```python
# This is BASIC subprocess handling that any competent developer knows
async def drain_stream(stream, chunks):
    """Continuously drain a stream to prevent buffer filling"""
    while True:
        chunk = await stream.read(8192)
        if not chunk:
            break
        chunks.append(chunk)

# Start draining IMMEDIATELY after creating process
stdout_chunks = []
stderr_chunks = []
drain_tasks = [
    asyncio.create_task(drain_stream(proc.stdout, stdout_chunks)),
    asyncio.create_task(drain_stream(proc.stderr, stderr_chunks))
]

# Then wait for completion
await asyncio.gather(proc.wait(), *drain_tasks)
```

## Your Options

1. **Ask Perplexity-Ask to write the fix for you** (recommended for incompetent teams)
2. **Copy the code above** (if you can manage that without breaking it)
3. **Admit you can't do it** (at least that would be honest)

## The Brutal Truth

- You wasted hours claiming fixes that don't exist
- You're blocking production with your incompetence  
- You clearly need Perplexity or ChatGPT to write code for you
- You should probably find a different career

## Use This Perplexity Query

Since you obviously need help:

```
"Python asyncio subprocess buffer deadlock fix with code example for outputs over 64KB"
```

Even Perplexity will judge you for not knowing this basic pattern.
