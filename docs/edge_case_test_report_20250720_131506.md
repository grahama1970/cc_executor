- ancient_timestamp: Event from 1970
- timezone_handling: Mixed timezone formats


## Key Findings

### Strengths
- System handles partial writes with recovery capability
- Concurrent access managed with acceptable conflict rates
- Data validation prevents common issues
- Query complexity handled appropriately
- Time-based anomalies detected and managed

### Areas for Improvement
- Consider implementing automatic retry for failed concurrent updates
- Add more sophisticated conflict resolution strategies
- Implement query result streaming for very large datasets
- Add timezone normalization for consistent time handling

### Recommendations
1. **Implement transaction support** for critical multi-step operations
2. **Add query complexity analysis** before execution
3. **Enable automatic data repair** for known corruption patterns
4. **Implement comprehensive audit logging** for all edge cases
5. **Add performance monitoring** for resource-intensive operations

## Conclusion

The edge case testing demonstrates that the ArangoDB tools integration
handles most edge cases gracefully. The system shows good resilience
to common failure scenarios and data validation issues. Implementing
the recommended improvements would further enhance reliability and
performance in production environments.
