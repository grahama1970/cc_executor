# Docker Testing Results

**Date**: 2025-07-10  
**Status**: PARTIALLY WORKING - Needs WebSocket fix

## Test Summary

### ✅ Docker Build (PASSED)
- Image builds successfully
- All dependencies installed
- Services configured correctly

### ✅ Container Startup (PASSED)
- Redis container: Running and healthy
- CC Executor container: Running
- Both API and WebSocket servers start

### ✅ API Server (PASSED)
- Health endpoint: Working on port 8001
- Returns healthy status
- Accessible from host

### ❌ WebSocket Server (FAILED)
- Connection established but no task processing
- Messages not being handled
- Disconnects after timeout

## Test Results

### 1. Container Status
```
✅ cc_execute container running
✅ Redis container healthy
✅ Ports mapped correctly:
   - 8001 -> 8000 (API)
   - 8004 -> 8003 (WebSocket)
```

### 2. Health Check
```
curl http://localhost:8001/health
{"status":"healthy","service":"cc-executor-api","timestamp":"2025-07-10T15:46:30.270870"}
```

### 3. WebSocket Issue
```
- Connection: ✅ Established
- Message handling: ❌ Not working
- Task execution: ❌ Not happening
```

## Identified Issues

### 1. WebSocket Message Handler
The WebSocket connects but doesn't process incoming messages. Possible causes:
- Message format mismatch
- Handler not properly configured
- Authentication issue

### 2. Environment Variables
Initially ANTHROPIC_API_KEY was not passed through. This has been fixed but WebSocket still not working.

## Docker Configuration

Current `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  cc_execute:
    environment:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}  # Now properly set
      REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379
      DISABLE_VENV_WRAPPING: "1"
```

## Next Steps to Fix

1. **Debug WebSocket Handler**
   - Check message format expected by handler
   - Verify task processing logic in container
   - Check for any authentication requirements

2. **Test Direct Execution**
   - Exec into container and test cc_execute directly
   - Verify Claude CLI works inside container

3. **Check Logs More Thoroughly**
   - Look for any error messages during task processing
   - Check if messages are being received but not processed

## Current Docker Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Build | ✅ Working | Image builds successfully |
| Startup | ✅ Working | Services start correctly |
| Redis | ✅ Working | Connected and healthy |
| API Server | ✅ Working | Health endpoint accessible |
| WebSocket | ❌ Not Working | Connects but doesn't process tasks |
| Overall | ⚠️ Partial | Needs WebSocket fix |

## Conclusion

Docker deployment is **PARTIALLY WORKING**. The infrastructure is set up correctly, but the WebSocket message handling needs to be fixed before it can process tasks.
