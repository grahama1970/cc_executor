# Progress Monitoring Summary for cc_executor

## Executive Summary

After extensive testing, we've confirmed that **MCP progress updates are not visible to Claude Code users**, despite being implemented in the code. This creates a poor user experience for long-running tasks.

## Key Findings

### 1. The Progress Reporting Problem

- **Issue**: `ctx.report_progress()` and `ctx.info()` calls in MCP tools don't display to users
- **Impact**: Users wait 5+ minutes with no feedback
- **Root Cause**: Claude Code doesn't support streaming MCP updates (confirmed in CLAUDE_WORKAROUNDS.md)

### 2. Test Results

#### MCP Version (`mcp__cc-execute__execute`)
- ❌ No progress updates visible during 5-minute execution
- ✅ Task completed successfully (created inverse square root algorithm)
- ❌ User had no visibility into what was happening

#### Prompt Version (`cc_execute.md`)
- ❌ Also timed out with no progress visibility
- ❌ WebSocket connection appeared to hang
- ❌ Same poor user experience

### 3. Workarounds Required

As documented in `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/docs/CLAUDE_WORKAROUNDS.md`:

1. **Log Monitoring Tools**: Create separate tools to poll logs
2. **Enhanced Result Format**: Include execution logs in final result
3. **Progress in Response**: Always include timeline in tool responses

## Recommendations

### Short Term (Implemented)

1. **Log Monitor Tool** (`/src/cc_executor/utils/log_monitor.py`)
   - Monitors WebSocket and MCP logs in real-time
   - Extracts progress events and displays them
   - Can be run in parallel with task execution

2. **Progress Summary in Results**
   ```python
   return {
       "result": "...",
       "execution_log": [
           "[00:00] Starting task",
           "[00:15] WebSocket connected",
           "[00:30] Research complete",
           "[01:45] Implementation complete",
           "[02:00] Task finished"
       ]
   }
   ```

### Long Term

1. **Wait for Claude Code Streaming Support**
   - Infrastructure is ready (ctx.report_progress implemented)
   - Will work automatically when Claude Code adds support

2. **Use Alternative Interfaces**
   - Consider using cc_executor directly via CLI for better progress visibility
   - Use WebSocket interface directly for real-time updates

## Current Status

- ✅ Early completion detection implemented and working
- ✅ MCP progress reporting code implemented
- ✅ WebSocket bidirectional communication working
- ❌ Progress updates not visible to Claude Code users
- ✅ Log monitoring workaround available

## Conclusion

While we've successfully implemented all the technical infrastructure for progress reporting, the lack of streaming support in Claude Code means users cannot see real-time updates. This is a **critical limitation** that makes both the MCP and prompt approaches unsuitable for long-running tasks without additional monitoring tools.

The best current approach is to:
1. Use the log monitoring tool for visibility
2. Include execution logs in all responses
3. Set user expectations about the lack of real-time updates

When Claude Code adds streaming support, all the infrastructure we've built will automatically provide the intended user experience.
