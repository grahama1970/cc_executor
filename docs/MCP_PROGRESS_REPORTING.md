# MCP Progress Reporting Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the bidirectional progress reporting implementation between FastMCP servers and the WebSocket handler in cc_executor.

## Implementation Details

### 1. FastMCP Context Usage

The MCP tools now properly use the FastMCP Context parameter for progress reporting:

```python
@mcp.tool
async def execute(ctx, task: str, timeout: int = 600) -> str:
    # Report initial progress
    await ctx.report_progress(0, 100)
    await ctx.info(f"Starting task: {task[:100]}...")
    
    # ... execute task ...
    
    # Report completion
    await ctx.report_progress(100, 100)
    await ctx.info(f"Task completed successfully")
```

### 2. Progress Reporting Methods

FastMCP provides two main methods for reporting progress:

- **`ctx.report_progress(current, total)`**: Reports numeric progress (e.g., 50/100)
- **`ctx.info(message)`**: Reports status messages and important events

### 3. WebSocket Integration

The cc_executor MCP server (`mcp_cc_execute.py`) now reports progress at key stages:

1. **Connection Stage (10%)**:
   - WebSocket connection established
   - Session ID obtained

2. **Execution Stage (20-90%)**:
   - Task execution started (20%)
   - Progress increments as output is received
   - Significant events (file creation, completion markers) are reported

3. **Completion Stage (95-100%)**:
   - Early completion detection (95%)
   - Process completion (100%)

### 4. Progress Events Flow

```
MCP Client (Claude)
    ↓
FastMCP Server (mcp_cc_execute.py)
    ↓ (ctx.report_progress)
WebSocket Client
    ↓
WebSocket Handler (websocket_handler.py)
    ↓
Process Execution
    ↓
Output Streaming
    ↓ (process.output events)

    ↓ (ctx.info)
MCP Client (Claude)
```

### 5. Key Progress Points

The implementation reports progress at these key points:

1. **Task Start**: 0% - Task received
2. **WebSocket Connected**: 10% - Connection established
3. **Execution Started**: 20% - Command sent to executor
4. **Output Streaming**: 20-90% - Incremental progress as output is received
5. **Early Completion**: 95% - If early completion is detected
6. **Process Complete**: 100% - Task fully completed

### 6. Error Handling

Progress reporting also includes error states:

- Timeout errors are reported with `ctx.info()`
- Execution errors are reported with error details
- WebSocket errors are caught and reported

### 7. Example Progress Stream

For a typical task execution:

```
[0%] Starting task: Create a Python function...
[10%] WebSocket connection established
[20%] Task execution started
[25%] Progress: Created file: fibonacci.py
[30%] Progress: Function implementation completed
[95%] Task logically completed (early detection)
[100%] Process completed with exit code 0
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Feedback**: Users see progress as tasks execute
2. **Early Completion Awareness**: Users know when tasks are logically done
3. **Error Transparency**: Errors are reported immediately
4. **Better UX**: No more wondering if a long task is stuck

## Testing

To test progress reporting:

1. Use the MCP tool with a long-running task:
   ```python
   result = await mcp__cc-execute__execute(
       "Create a complex Python application with multiple files"
   )
   ```

2. Monitor the progress updates in Claude's interface

3. Check logs in `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/logs/` for detailed progress tracking

## Future Enhancements

1. **Granular Progress**: Report progress based on specific task milestones
2. **Progress Persistence**: Store progress in Redis for recovery
3. **Custom Progress Patterns**: Allow tasks to define their own progress milestones
4. **Progress Visualization**: Add progress bars or charts for complex tasks
