# Task: Comprehensive Pre-Deployment Code Review

**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Component**: All (client, core, hooks, docs, tests)  
**Created**: 2025-01-08  
**Status**: PENDING

## Objective

Perform a thorough code review of the CC Executor project to ensure it's ready for deployment. Focus on developer experience, reliability, and proper documentation.

## Context

The CC Executor project has undergone significant refactoring:
- Migration from `return_json` to `json_mode` parameter
- Hook system made async-safe
- 43 unreferenced files archived
- Documentation deduplicated
- Test structure reorganized

Now we need a comprehensive review before deployment to ensure:
1. The API works reliably for developers
2. Documentation is clear and examples are helpful
3. Error handling provides actionable feedback
4. Performance is acceptable for production use

## Review Scope

### 1. Core Functionality Review
- `src/cc_executor/client/cc_execute.py` - Main Python API
- `src/cc_executor/core/websocket_handler.py` - WebSocket server
- `src/cc_executor/core/process_manager.py` - Process execution
- `src/cc_executor/hooks/hook_integration.py` - Hook system

### 2. Utility Review
- `src/cc_executor/utils/json_utils.py` - JSON parsing robustness
- `src/cc_executor/utils/prompt_amender.py` - Prompt modification logic

### 3. Test Review
- `tests/integration/test_simple_prompt_with_mcp.py` - Example usage
- `tests/README.md` - Test running instructions
- Developer experience with examples

### 4. Documentation Review
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` - Getting started
- `docs/guides/` - User guides
- API documentation completeness

## Specific Areas to Analyze

### Developer Experience
1. Is the `cc_execute()` API intuitive?
2. Are error messages helpful for debugging?
3. Do the examples clearly show common use cases?
4. Is the setup process straightforward?

### Reliability
1. Does `clean_json_string` handle all edge cases?
2. Are timeouts calculated reasonably?
3. Is the hook system properly isolated?
4. Are subprocess streams drained correctly?

### Performance
1. Is 28-second average for simple prompts acceptable?
2. Does Redis caching improve performance?
3. Is memory usage stable for long-running tasks?

### Code Quality
1. Are all functions properly documented?
2. Is error handling consistent?
3. Are there any code smells or anti-patterns?
4. Is the code maintainable?

## Deliverables

1. **Assessment Report** (`021_deployment_review_assessment.md`):
   - Strengths and weaknesses per component
   - Specific file + line references for issues
   - Overall deployment readiness verdict

2. **Fix List** (`021_deployment_review_fixes.json`):
   - Prioritized list of issues to address
   - Each issue with file, line, and suggested fix

## Success Criteria

The review is complete when:
1. All files in scope have been reviewed line-by-line
2. Developer usage has been validated with examples
3. A clear verdict on deployment readiness is provided
4. Any blocking issues are identified with fixes

## Notes

- Focus on actual functionality over theoretical concerns
- Prioritize developer experience and reliability
- Keep suggestions simple and actionable
- Consider real-world usage patterns
