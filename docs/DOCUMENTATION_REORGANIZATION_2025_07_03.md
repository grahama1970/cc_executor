# Documentation Reorganization Summary (2025-07-03)

## Overview
This document summarizes the documentation cleanup and reorganization performed on July 3, 2025.

## Changes Made

### 1. Archived Old Documentation
Moved the following to `archive/old_docs_reorganization/`:
- Multiple old reorganization documents from June-July 2025
- Previous iteration assessment files
- Outdated structural documentation

### 2. Consolidated Duplicate Content
- **Merged Troubleshooting Guides**: Combined `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` and `troubleshooting.md` into a single comprehensive guide at `guides/troubleshooting.md`
- **Removed Core Redundancy**: Moved `core/prompts/README.md` content to `docs/assessment/README.md` to eliminate duplicate READMEs

### 3. Updated Key Documentation
- **quickstart.md**: 
  - Updated installation instructions to use `uv`
  - Added CLI commands as primary usage method
  - Updated environment variables for shell configuration
  - Added notes about Claude Max limitations
  - Fixed port numbers (8003 instead of 8004)
  
- **troubleshooting.md**:
  - Added shell-specific troubleshooting section
  - Updated environment variables section
  - Added known Claude CLI issues (like `-p` vs `--print`)
  - Added Claude Max limitations section

### 4. Project Cleanup
- Moved ~400+ files from project root to appropriate directories:
  - Test files → `tests/integration/`
  - Documentation → `docs/`
  - Assessment files → `archive/`
  - Old reports → `archive/`

### 5. Documentation Structure
Current structure:
```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Main docs index
├── quickstart.md               # Updated quick start guide
├── MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md      # New memory handling docs
├── CLAUDE_MAX_SDK_OPTIONS.md   # Claude Max specific info
├── architecture/               # System architecture docs
├── guides/                     # User guides
├── technical/                  # Technical implementation details
├── hooks/                      # Hook system documentation
├── features/                   # Feature documentation
├── templates/                  # Assessment templates
├── reports/                    # Assessment reports
└── archive/                    # Old/deprecated docs
```

## Key Updates to Main README
- Added honest explanation of why project exists (Claude Max limitations)
- Documented the $200/month paradox (premium users can't use API)
- Added shell consistency features
- Updated recent improvements section
- Added comparison table with official SDK

## Timeout Documentation
Note: We have timeout documentation in multiple places serving different purposes:
- `technical/timeout_management.md` - Implementation details
- `technical/asyncio_timeout_guide.md` - Generic asyncio guide
- `guides/timeout_configuration.md` - User/agent guide

These are intentionally separate as they serve different audiences.

## Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring for new redundant documentation
2. Update documentation as new features are added
3. Keep archive organized for historical reference
4. Maintain clear separation between user guides and technical docs

## Files Removed
- `docs/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (merged into troubleshooting.md)
- `src/cc_executor/core/prompts/README.md` (content moved to docs)
- ~400+ files from project root (moved to appropriate directories)

## Files Created
- `docs/MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md`
- `docs/archive/old_docs_reorganization/` (directory with old docs)
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` (in project root)

This reorganization makes the documentation more maintainable and easier to navigate, while preserving historical context in the archive.
