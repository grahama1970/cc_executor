      "status": "Validated",
      "analysis_summary": "The file contains hard-coded default credentials, posing a security risk.",
      "recommendation": "Externalize credentials using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management service."

      "issue_id": "2",
      "original_description": "Monolithic ArangoTools class violates SRP",
      "status": "Validated",
      "analysis_summary": "The ArangoTools class has too many responsibilities (CRUD, graph ops, admin), making it difficult to maintain.",
      "recommendation": "Refactor the class into smaller, more focused modules based on responsibility (e.g., NodeManager, EdgeManager, GraphAdmin)."

      "issue_id": "3",
      "original_description": "Duplicated tool-sequence optimization logic",
      "status": "Validated",
      "analysis_summary": "The core optimization algorithm is duplicated across two files, leading to code redundancy.",
      "recommendation": "Consolidate the duplicated logic into a single, reusable function or utility module and import it where needed."

      "issue_id": "4",
      "original_description": "Tests depend on a live database",
      "status": "Refuted",
      "analysis_summary": "Investigation revealed tests do not require a live database. They use local JSONSchema validation and a mocked Redis ping.",
      "recommendation": "None. The original finding was incorrect."

      "original_description": "Inefficient subprocess execution in logger server",
      "status": "Validated",
      "analysis_summary": "The run_tool function invokes uv run in a new subprocess for every request, causing significant performance overhead.",
      "recommendation": "Replace the per-call subprocess with a more efficient approach, such as a long-running worker pool or by importing and calling the tool's function directly within the async event loop."

      "issue_id": "6",
      "original_description": "Embedded HTML templates in Python code",
      "status": "Validated",
      "analysis_summary": "Large blocks of HTML are embedded as strings within Python functions, mixing presentation with logic.",
      "recommendation": "Separate concerns by moving HTML to external template files and using a templating engine like Jinja2 to render them."
