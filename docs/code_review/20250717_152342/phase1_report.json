      "issue_type": "security",
      "title": "Hardcoded Fallback Credentials",
      "description": "The `_connect` method in `ArangoTools` uses hardcoded fallback credentials (`root`, `openSesame`). This is a significant security vulnerability as it embeds sensitive information directly in the source code, which could be exploited if the code is ever exposed.",
      "suggested_fix": "Remove the fallback values from `os.getenv`. The application should instead raise an explicit `ValueError` if the required environment variables (ARANGO_URL, ARANGO_DATABASE, ARANGO_USERNAME, ARANGO_PASSWORD) are not set, enforcing a secure configuration.",

      "issue_type": "architecture",
      "title": "Monolithic `ArangoTools` Class",
      "description": "The `ArangoTools` class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by handling numerous unrelated concerns: database connection, schema management, generic AQL execution, CRUD operations, glossary management, research caching, learning system logic, and graph analysis. This makes the class large (over 2000 lines), difficult to maintain, and hard to test.",
      "suggested_fix": "For a future phase, this class should be broken into smaller, more focused classes (e.g., `ArangoConnector`, `ArangoCRUD`, `GraphAnalytics`, `GlossaryManager`). For this phase, the issue is documented as high-priority architectural debt.",

      "title": "Duplicated Logic for Tool Sequence Optimization",
      "description": "The files `mcp_tool_journey.py` and `mcp_tool_sequence_optimizer.py` have significant functional overlap. Both aim to find and manage optimal tool sequences, leading to duplicated effort and potential for inconsistencies.",
      "suggested_fix": "Consolidate the logic into a single, unified server. The functionality from `mcp_tool_sequence_optimizer.py` should be merged into `mcp_tool_journey.py`, and the former should be deprecated. This will create a single source of truth for tool journey management.",

      "title": "Tests Depend on a Live Database",
      "description": "The test functions in this file instantiate `ArangoTools` and execute queries directly against a live ArangoDB instance. This makes them integration tests, not unit tests. They are slow, brittle (dependent on data state), and cannot be run in an environment without a configured database.",
      "suggested_fix": "Use a mocking library (like Python's `unittest.mock`) to patch the `ArangoTools` methods (`execute_aql`, `analyze_graph`). This will isolate the test logic from the database, allowing for fast, predictable, and independent unit tests.",

      "issue_type": "architecture",
      "title": "Inefficient and Opaque Subprocess Execution",
      "description": "The server uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` to run other tool scripts via `uv run`. This creates a new process for every tool call, which is inefficient and introduces latency. It also creates a fragile dependency on the file system and `uv` CLI.",
      "suggested_fix": "Refactor the underlying tool scripts so their core logic can be imported as Python functions. The MCP server should then call these functions directly in the same process, improving performance and simplifying the architecture.",

      "title": "Embedded HTML Templates in Python Code",
      "description": "The file contains large, multi-line HTML strings for D3.js templates directly within Python methods (e.g., `_get_force_template`). This makes the code hard to read and difficult for front-end developers to edit without touching Python logic.",
      "suggested_fix": "Move the HTML content into separate `.html.j2` files. Use the existing Jinja2 environment to load these templates from the filesystem. This separates concerns and improves maintainability.",
