Excellent question. Implementing the proposed changes will significantly increase the robustness and correctness of the MCP suite. Consequently, the testing scenarios must evolve from simply verifying "happy path" functionality to actively validating these new robustness and learning features.

Here is a detailed analysis of how the usage scenarios should be amended, presented as a guide for the agent.

### **Amending Usage Scenarios: A Guide for the Testing Agent**

**To:** Claude Code, Principal SWE & Test Automation Specialist  
**From:** Code Review Lead  
**Subject:** Updating Test Scenarios to Validate a More Robust System

The recent code review and its successful implementation have fundamentally improved the MCP server suite. Our testing philosophy must now shift. We are no longer just asking, *"Does it work?"* We are now asking:

1.  **Is it resilient?** (Does it handle failures gracefully?)
2.  **Is it correct?** (Does it learn from sequences properly?)
3.  **Is it maintainable?** (Is the architecture sound?)
4.  **Is it secure?** (Are inputs and outputs handled safely?)

The following amendments to your testing scenarios are designed to validate these new qualities.

---

### **1. Core Workflow Change: Adapting to the Standardized Response Schema**

This is the **most critical change** and affects **every single scenario**. All tool calls will now return a predictable JSON object. Your "Formulate a Plan" and "Execute and Analyze" steps must be updated to reflect this.

**Old Approach (Implicit):**
- Assume the direct output is the result.
- Handle errors with `try...except` or by parsing inconsistent error strings.

**New, Required Approach (Explicit):**
- Every tool call returns a dictionary.
- **ALWAYS** check `result['success']` before proceeding.
- If `True`, the payload is in `result['data']`.
- If `False`, the reason is in `result['error']`.

#### **Example Plan Transformation:**

**Scenario 1 (Before):**
```
# Plan
1. Call english_to_aql("...") -> aql_query
2. Call query(aql_query) -> results
```

**Scenario 1 (After - REQUIRED UPDATE):**
```
# Plan
1. Call english_to_aql("...")
   - Assert result['success'] is True
   - Extract aql_query from result['data']['aql']
2. Call query(aql_query)
   - Assert result['success'] is True
   - Extract documents from result['data']['results']
```

**This change must be applied to all 20 scenarios.**

### **2. Amendments for `arango_tools_20_scenarios.md`**

This file tests high-level, realistic workflows. We need to update existing scenarios and add a new one to test the corrected learning logic.

#### **Update to Scenario 2 & 9 (Visualization):**

The tools `get_visualization_data` and `prepare_graph_for_d3` have been replaced by a more robust two-step process.

**Old "Expected Claude Actions":**
```
- [ ] 2. get_visualization_data(...)
- [ ] 4. prepare_graph_for_d3(...)
```

**New "Expected Claude Actions":**
```diff
- [ ] 2. get_visualization_data(...)
- [ ] 4. prepare_graph_for_d3(...)
+ [ ] 2. `mcp__d3_visualization_advisor__analyze_and_recommend_visualization(...)` to determine the best layout.
+ [ ] 3. Parse the advisor's response to select a `layout` (e.g., 'force-clustered').
+ [ ] 4. `mcp__d3_visualizer__generate_graph_visualization(...)` using the data and the recommended layout.
```

#### **New Scenario to Add: Scenario 21 (Sequence-Dependent Learning)**

This scenario is crucial for verifying the fix to the flawed state hashing in `mcp_tool_journey.py`.

```markdown
### Scenario 21: Validating Sequence-Dependent Learning
- [ ] **Started**
- [ ] **Plan Approved**
- [ ] **Executed Successfully**
- [ ] **Report Updated**
- [ ] **Completed**

**Prompt**: "First, analyze the error patterns for 'TimeoutError', then find similar journeys. Separately, try finding similar journeys first, then analyzing the patterns. Do these different approaches yield different recommendations?"

**Expected Claude Actions:**
```
- [ ] 1. **Path A**:
    - [ ] `mcp_tool_journey.start_journey("Analyze then find for TimeoutError")`
    - [ ] `mcp_tool_journey.record_tool_step(tool_name="analyze_graph_patterns")` -> Get next recommendation.
    - [ ] `mcp_tool_journey.record_tool_step(tool_name="find_similar_documents")`
    - [ ] `mcp_tool_journey.complete_journey(outcome="success")`
- [ ] 2. **Path B**:
    - [ ] `mcp_tool_journey.start_journey("Find then analyze for TimeoutError")`
    - [ ] `mcp_tool_journey.record_tool_step(tool_name="find_similar_documents")` -> Get next recommendation.
    - [ ] `mcp_tool_journey.record_tool_step(tool_name="analyze_graph_patterns")`
    - [ ] `mcp_tool_journey.complete_journey(outcome="success")`
- [ ] 3. **Verification**:
    - [ ] `mcp_arango_tools.query` the `q_values` collection.
    - [ ] **Assert** that the Q-value for the state `[analyze_graph_patterns]` leading to `find_similar_documents` is different from the state `[find_similar_documents]` leading to `analyze_graph_patterns`.
```

**Goal of this test:** To prove that the learning system now correctly distinguishes between different sequences of the same tools.

### **3. Amendments for `arango_tools_edge_cases.md`**

This file is perfect for testing the new resilience features.

#### **Update to Scenario 2 (Data Quality):**

The "Expected Behavior" can now be much more specific.

**Old "Expected Behavior":**
- Clear validation errors
- Helpful suggestions for fixes

**New "Expected Behavior":**
```diff
- Clear validation errors
- Helpful suggestions for fixes
+ **Expect a JSON response with `{'success': False, 'error': 'A descriptive message...'}`.**
+ **Verify the error message clearly states the validation failure (e.g., 'Required field "message" is missing').**
```

#### **New Scenario for Category 10 (Resilience):**

Add a specific test for the new database connection resilience.

**New Test Case:**
```markdown
### Scenario 10.1: Database Connection Resilience

**Test**: Simulate a database connection drop during a multi-step workflow.

```python
# 1. Start a workflow
await mcp__arango_tools__insert(message="Step 1: Start process")

# 2. SIMULATE DATABASE RESTART (Manually or via a script)
# e.g., `sudo systemctl restart arangodb3`

# 3. Wait for 5 seconds to ensure connection is dropped
await asyncio.sleep(5)

# 4. Attempt the next step in the workflow
result = await mcp__arango_tools__insert(
    message="Step 2: Continue process after DB restart"
)

# 5. Verify the outcome
# assert result['success'] is True
# assert "Re-established database connection" in logs
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- The tool call in step 4 should initially fail to connect.
- The new retry logic with exponential back-off should trigger.
- The tool should successfully reconnect and complete the operation without crashing the MCP server.
- The final result should be `{'success': True, ...}`.
```

### **4. Amendments for `arango_tools_integration_scenarios.md`**

These complex pipelines are ideal for testing the new architectural improvements.

#### **Update to ALL Scenarios (General):**

Every step in every workflow must now include a check for `result['success']` and extract data from `result['data']`. This makes the pipelines more robust.

**Example Transformation (Scenario 1):**
```python
# Before
structured = await mcp__document_structurer__process_document_fully(...)
doc_id = await mcp__arango_tools__insert(metadata=structured)

# After
structured_result = await mcp__document_structurer__process_document_fully(...)
if not structured_result['success']:
    # Handle error and exit pipeline
    return {"error": "Failed to structure document"}
structured_data = structured_result['data']

insert_result = await mcp__arango_tools__insert(metadata=structured_data)
if not insert_result['success']:
    # Handle error
    return {"error": "Failed to insert document"}
doc_id = insert_result['data']['id']
```

#### **Update to Scenario 1 & 5 (Visualization):**

Similar to the 20-scenarios file, update the visualization steps to use the `advisor` -> `visualizer` pipeline.

#### **New Integration Scenario to Add: Scenario 6 (Full Learning Loop)**

This scenario tests the end-to-end interaction of the most heavily modified learning components.

```markdown
### Scenario 6: Full End-to-End Learning Loop Validation

**Real-world use case**: An agent encounters a new error, solves it, and the system learns from the experience, making the solution easier to find next time.

**Workflow**:
```python
# 1. Start a new journey for a NOVEL error
start_res = await mcp__tool_journey__start_journey(
    task_description="Fix a novel 'TqdmDeprecationWarning' in the logger"
)
journey_id = start_res['data']['journey_id']

# 2. Record the steps of the successful journey
await mcp__tool_journey__record_tool_step(journey_id, "arango_tools.query", ...)
await mcp__tool_journey__record_tool_step(journey_id, "cc_execute.execute_task", ...)
await mcp__tool_journey__record_tool_step(journey_id, "kilocode_review.start_review", ...)
# ... more steps ...

# 3. Adjudicate the outcome as successful
adjudicate_res = await mcp__outcome_adjudicator__adjudicate_outcome(
    journey_context_json=json.dumps({"actual_sequence": [...]}),
    final_artifacts_json=json.dumps({"fix_applied": "..."})
)
final_reward = adjudicate_res['data']['final_reward']

# 4. Complete the journey to backpropagate the reward
await mcp__tool_journey__complete_journey(
    journey_id,
    outcome="optimal_completion",
    final_reward=final_reward
)

# 5. VERIFICATION: Start a similar journey again
start_res_2 = await mcp__tool_journey__start_journey(
    task_description="Resolve a TqdmDeprecationWarning"
)

# 6. Assert that the recommended sequence in `start_res_2` matches the
#    successful sequence from the first journey, and that its confidence score
#    is higher than the initial run.
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- The system correctly records and adjudicates the journey.
- The `complete_journey` call successfully updates the Q-values in the database.
- The second call to `start_journey` for a similar task leverages the new knowledge to provide a better, more confident recommendation.

This amended testing strategy will ensure that the newly implemented robustness and learning features are not just present, but are actively validated as part of your core workflow.
