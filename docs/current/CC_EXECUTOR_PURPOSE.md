# CC-Executor: Understanding Its True Purpose

## The Fundamental Misunderstanding

**WRONG**: CC-Executor is a tool for executing single tasks via MCP
**RIGHT**: CC-Executor enables orchestrators to manage multi-step task lists

## What CC-Executor Actually Is

CC-Executor is an **orchestration enabler** that solves a specific problem:
- When Claude (the orchestrator) needs to execute multi-step workflows
- Each step might need a fresh Claude instance (200K context)
- Steps must execute sequentially (Task 2 waits for Task 1)
- WebSockets ensure the orchestrator waits between spawning instances

## The Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Orchestrator  │  ← Main Claude managing the workflow
│     (Claude)    │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ Uses cc_execute.md
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   CC-Executor   │  ← WebSocket server enforcing sequence
│  (WebSocket)    │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ Spawns
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Worker Claude  │  ← Fresh 200K context for each task
│   (Instance)    │
└─────────────────┘
```

## Correct Usage Pattern

### 1. Orchestrator Creates Task List
```markdown
Task 1: Research Redis best practices with perplexity-ask
Task 2: Using cc_execute.md: Implement Redis cache with connection pooling
Task 3: Using cc_execute.md: Review code with external AI model
Task 4: Run tests and verify functionality
```

### 2. Orchestrator Uses Support Tools
```python
# Check if WebSocket server is ready
status = await check_websocket_status()

# Analyze task complexity
complexity = await get_task_complexity("Implement Redis cache")

# Get execution strategy
strategy = await suggest_execution_strategy(tasks)
```

### 3. Orchestrator Executes Based on Strategy
- Simple tasks: Direct execution
- Complex tasks: Use cc_execute.md prompt
- Each cc_execute.md spawns fresh Claude instance
- WebSocket ensures sequential execution

## What CC-Executor is NOT

❌ **NOT a single task executor**
- Don't: `execute("Write a function")`
- Do: Use in multi-step task lists

❌ **NOT an MCP replacement for cc_execute.md**
- Don't: Try to execute directly via MCP
- Do: Use MCP tools for orchestration support

❌ **NOT for simple Claude calls**
- Don't: Use for basic prompts
- Do: Use for complex multi-step workflows

## The Key Insight

CC-Executor exists because:
1. Claude can't control execution order when spawning sub-instances
2. Complex workflows need fresh context for each major step
3. WebSockets provide the synchronization mechanism
4. This enables 10+ hour workflows with 50+ sequential tasks

## MCP Tools Purpose

The MCP tools (`mcp_cc_execute.py`) provide:
- **Orchestration support** - Help plan execution
- **Health monitoring** - Ensure server is ready
- **Task analysis** - Determine complexity
- **Strategy recommendations** - Optimize execution

They do NOT:
- Execute tasks directly
- Replace cc_execute.md
- Spawn Claude instances

## Summary

CC-Executor = Orchestration Infrastructure
- Enables multi-step workflows
- Ensures sequential execution
- Provides fresh context per task
- Uses cc_execute.md prompts

It's like a conductor's baton - it doesn't make music, it coordinates the orchestra.
