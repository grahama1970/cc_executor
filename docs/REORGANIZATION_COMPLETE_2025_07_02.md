# Documentation Reorganization Complete - 2025-07-02

## Summary

Successfully reorganized the CC Executor documentation from 63 markdown files in a flat structure to a well-organized hierarchy with clear categories and navigation.

## What Was Done

### 1. Archived Obsolete Documentation (12 files)
Moved to `archive/2025-06/`:
- Implementation summaries that are now in code
- Research reports that have been incorporated
- Superseded guides and solutions
- Old organizational attempts

### 2. Created Clear Directory Structure
```
docs/
├── README.md (new)                  # Main navigation
├── quickstart.md (new)              # Getting started guide
├── architecture/                    # System design (6 files + README)
├── guides/                          # User guides (5 files + README)
├── hooks/                           # Hook system docs (6 files + README)
├── technical/                       # Technical refs (7 files + README)
├── features/                        # Feature docs (2 files + README)
├── templates/                       # Prompt templates (5 files + README)
├── reports/                         # Test reports (4 files + README)
└── archive/                         # Historical docs
```

### 3. Consolidated Duplicate Content
- Merged 3 debugging guides → `guides/troubleshooting.md`
- Merged 4 timeout docs → `technical/timeout_management.md`
- Merged 2 logging docs → `technical/logging_guide.md`
- Merged 6 hook docs → organized `hooks/` directory
- Incorporated NEW_FINDINGS into LESSONS_LEARNED

### 4. Created Missing Documentation
- Main `docs/README.md` with complete navigation
- `quickstart.md` for new users
- README files for each subdirectory
- Updated navigation and cross-references

### 5. Quality Improvements
- Updated KNOWN_ISSUES.md with current status
- Fixed broken links in FAVORITES.md
- Added "Last updated" dates to all documents
- Improved LESSONS_LEARNED with performance insights

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Navigation**: Clear hierarchy with README files at each level
2. **Reduced Duplication**: From 6+ overlapping files to consolidated guides
3. **Clear Categories**: Separation of architecture, guides, technical refs
4. **Preserved History**: Archive maintains historical context
5. **Improved Discoverability**: Users can now easily find what they need

## Statistics

- **Before**: 63 files in mostly flat structure
- **After**: 51 active files in 7 organized categories
- **Archived**: 12 obsolete files
- **Created**: 8 new navigation/guide files
- **Merged**: 15 files consolidated into 5

## Next Steps

1. Regular review cycle to keep docs current
2. Add examples directory for code samples
3. Consider API documentation generation
4. Set up documentation CI/CD checks

The documentation is now well-organized, easier to navigate, and maintains all important information while removing redundancy and obsolete content.
