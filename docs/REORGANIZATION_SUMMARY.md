## Date: 2025-06-27

## Actions Taken

### 1. Archive Directory
- ✅ Archive directory already existed at project root (no action needed)

### 2. Moved to Archive
- ✅ `docs/conversations` → Already in `archive/docs_conversations` (no action needed)
- ✅ `docs/CONFIG_ENVIRONMENT.md` → Already in `archive/CONFIG_ENVIRONMENT.md` (no action needed)
- ✅ `docs/TRANSCRIPT_LOGGING.md` → `archive/TRANSCRIPT_LOGGING.md`

### 3. Content Merged
- ✅ Merged `TRANSCRIPT_LOGGING.md` content into `LOGGING.md`
  - Added new section "5. Full Transcript Logs (No Truncation)"
  - Added "Transcript Logging Usage" section with code examples
  - Updated "Finding Recent Logs" to include transcript logs
  - Enhanced "Important Notes" with transcript-specific information

## Current Structure

### docs/
Clean documentation focused on current usage:
- `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md`
- `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`
- `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
- `LOGGING.md` (now includes transcript logging info)
- `REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md`
- `TRANSCRIPT_LIMITATIONS.md`
- `VSCODE_DEBUG_STANDARD.md`
- `architecture/` - Architecture documentation
- `guides/` - Operating guides

### archive/
Historical and deprecated documentation:
- `CONFIG_ENVIRONMENT.md`
- `TRANSCRIPT_LOGGING.md`
- `docs_conversations/`
- Various other archived materials

## Benefits

1. **Consolidated Logging Documentation**: All logging information now in one place (`LOGGING.md`)
2. **Cleaner Docs Directory**: Removed redundant/deprecated files
3. **Preserved History**: Important content preserved in archive for reference
4. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between current and historical documentation
