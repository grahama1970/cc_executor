# MCP Verification Tool Integration Report

**Date**: 2025-07-10  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Successfully integrated anti-hallucination verification as an MCP tool in CC Executor, making reporting a crucial part of every execution as requested.

## What Was Done

### 1. **MCP Tool Registration**
- Added `verify_execution` tool to `/src/cc_executor/servers/mcp_cc_execute.py`
- Tool accepts parameters: `execution_uuid`, `last_n`, `generate_report`
- Returns verification status with hallucination detection

### 2. **Fixed Verification System**
- Corrected path issue in `hallucination_check.py` (was looking in wrong directory)
- Updated to check `/src/cc_executor/client/tmp/responses/`
- Added receipt file checking alongside JSON response verification

### 3. **Enhanced Reporting Functions**
- Updated `generate_hallucination_report()` to accept pre-computed verifications
- Changed to return Path object instead of string
- Added support for custom output filenames

### 4. **Automatic Receipt Generation**
- Already integrated in `cc_execute.py` from previous work
- Every execution creates both JSON response and markdown receipt
- Receipts stored in `/client/tmp/responses/receipts/`

### 5. **Documentation Updates**
- Created `/docs/MCP_VERIFICATION_TOOL.md` explaining the feature
- Updated README.md with anti-hallucination section
- Added v1.3.0 release notes highlighting the verification system

## Technical Details

### MCP Tool Signature
```python
@mcp.tool(
    description="""Verify that recent cc_execute calls are not hallucinated.
    This tool checks for physical JSON response files on disk to prove executions happened.
    Use this to generate anti-hallucination reports and verify execution results.
    
    Examples:
    - Verify the last execution
    - Check a specific execution UUID
    - Generate a verification report for the last 5 executions
    """
)
async def verify_execution(
    execution_uuid: Optional[str] = None,
    last_n: int = 1,
    generate_report: bool = True
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

### Verification Process
1. Checks for physical JSON files in response directory
2. Validates JSON structure and content
3. Looks for matching receipt files
4. Returns hallucination status and details
5. Optionally generates markdown report

## Benefits

1. **Trust**: MCP clients can verify executions aren't fabricated
2. **Auditability**: Every execution leaves permanent evidence
3. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing MCP tools
4. **Automation**: No manual steps needed for verification

## Usage Examples

### Via MCP Protocol
```python
result = await mcp_client.call_tool("verify_execution", {
    "last_n": 5,
    "generate_report": True
})
```

### Manual Verification
```bash
python -m cc_executor.reporting.hallucination_check report
```

## Testing Results

Confirmed working with test script:
- Execution creates JSON response file ✅
- Receipt automatically generated ✅
- Verification finds both files ✅
- MCP tool response format correct ✅

## Next Steps

The MCP verification tool is now fully integrated and available for use. This completes the user's request to make verification "a registered part of the MCP tools".
