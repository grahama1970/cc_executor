# CC Executor Final Assessment Report

**Date**: 2025-07-09  
**Assessment UUID**: `32be1e2e-880a-460e-afce-538ebb23fc73`

## Executive Summary

This assessment evaluates the CC Executor service across three deployment modes: Python API, MCP Local WebSocket, and Docker. The Python API and Docker deployments show 100% success rates, while the MCP Local implementation faces persistent WebSocket connection issues that prevent successful operation.

## Test Results Summary

### Overall Success Rates
- **Python API**: 100% (5/5 tests passed)
- **MCP Local**: 0% (0/3 tests passed)
- **Docker**: 100% (5/5 tests passed)

### Performance Metrics
- **Python API**: Average execution time 7.45s
- **MCP Local**: Tests fail immediately (< 0.02s)
- **Docker**: Average execution time 2.50s

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Python API (Direct Usage)
**Status**: ✅ Fully Operational

The Python API demonstrates consistent performance across all test scenarios:
- Simple calculations: 7.04s
- Code generation: 7.29s
- JSON mode: 7.19s
- Long tasks: 7.97s
- Error handling: 7.77s

All outputs are correctly formatted and include proper UUID verification.

### 2. MCP Local WebSocket
**Status**: ❌ Non-Functional

Critical issues identified:
1. **Server Lifecycle Management**: The server starts successfully but requires persistent process management
2. **CLI Integration**: The `cc-executor server start` command blocks in foreground, preventing proper daemon operation
3. **WebSocket Connection**: Client connections fail with "Connection refused" errors
4. **Process Management**: ServerManager utility is integrated but server processes terminate unexpectedly

#### Root Cause Analysis
Through consultation with Gemini and extensive debugging:
- The server runs correctly when started directly with `uvicorn`
- The CLI command doesn't properly daemonize the server process
- Subprocess.PIPE blocking issues were resolved by redirecting to log files
- The stress test WebSocket client cannot connect due to server availability issues

### 3. Docker Deployment
**Status**: ✅ Fully Operational

Docker deployment shows excellent performance:
- WebSocket endpoint: 100% success rate
- REST API endpoint: 100% success rate
- Average response time: 2.50s (significantly faster than Python API)
- Proper process isolation and management

## Key Technical Improvements Made

### 1. WebSocket Streaming Fix
Added missing constants to `websocket_handler.py`:
```python
except ImportError:
    # Define missing constants for Docker/standalone execution
    COMPLETION_MARKERS = [...]
    FILE_CREATION_PATTERN = r'...'
    TOKEN_LIMIT_PATTERNS = [...]
```

### 2. ServerManager Integration
Integrated existing `ServerManager` utility into CLI:
```python
from ..utils.server_manager import ServerManager
manager = ServerManager("cc_executor")
await manager.cleanup()
```

### 3. Subprocess Management
Fixed PIPE blocking issue:
```python
with open(log_file, 'w') as log_f:
    process = subprocess.Popen(
        cmd,
        env=env,
        stdout=log_f,
        stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
        start_new_session=True
    )
```

### 4. Proper Uvicorn Startup
Updated to use standard uvicorn command:
```python
cmd = [
    sys.executable,
    "-m", "uvicorn",
    "cc_executor.core.main:app",
    "--host", host,
    "--port", str(actual_port)
]
```

## Remaining Issues

### MCP Local Server Stability
The core issue is not with the server code itself, but with process management:
1. The server runs correctly when started manually
2. The CLI needs a proper daemon mode implementation
3. Consider using `supervisor` or `systemd` for production deployments

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Implement proper daemon mode for `cc-executor server start`
   - Add health check monitoring to restart failed servers
   - Consider using `python-daemon` or similar library

2. **Long-term Improvements**:
   - Migrate to systemd service for production
   - Add WebSocket connection pooling
   - Implement automatic retry logic in WebSocketClient

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Add troubleshooting guide for server startup issues
   - Document manual uvicorn startup as workaround
   - Update Docker deployment as recommended approach

```

## Conclusion

CC Executor demonstrates solid functionality in both Python API and Docker deployment modes. The MCP Local WebSocket implementation requires additional work on process management and daemon operations. For production use, Docker deployment is recommended due to its superior performance and reliability.

The core WebSocket server code is functional and properly handles connections when running. The primary challenge is ensuring the server process remains active and accessible for client connections in the MCP Local deployment scenario.
