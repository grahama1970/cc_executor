# CC_Execute Final Architecture Decision

**Date**: 2025-01-04  
**Decision**: Continue using prompt-based approach for cc_execute  
**Context**: Task list orchestration  

## Executive Summary

After extensive evaluation including MCP bridge implementation and testing, the decision is to continue using cc_execute as a **prompt-based tool** specifically for **task list orchestration**.

## Key Findings

### 1. cc_execute Purpose Clarification

cc_execute is ONLY valuable in task list contexts for sequential execution:
- **Task Lists**: Use cc_execute.md to orchestrate multiple sequential tasks
- **Single Tasks**: Just use Claude Code directly (no orchestration needed)

### 2. MCP Evaluation Results

| Approach | Success Rate | Complexity | Use Case Fit |
|----------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Prompt-based | 10:1 | Low | Perfect for task lists |
| MCP wrapper | Failed | High | Over-engineered |

### 3. Why Prompts Win for This Use Case

1. **Simplicity**: No additional servers, protocols, or dependencies
2. **Reliability**: Proven 10:1 success ratio in production
3. **Flexibility**: Prompts can self-improve and adapt
4. **Correct Abstraction**: Task lists need orchestration, not programmatic wrappers

## The Orchestration Pattern

```
ORCHESTRATOR (Main Claude)          WORKER CLAUDES (via cc_execute.md)
    │                                         │
    ├─ Manages task sequence                 ├─ Fresh 200K context each
    ├─ Tracks progress                       ├─ Focused on single task
    ├─ Handles errors                        ├─ No knowledge of other tasks
    └─ Coordinates results                   └─ Clean execution environment
```

## When to Use cc_execute.md

### ✅ Perfect Use Cases (Task Lists)

1. **Sequential Dependencies**
   ```
   Task 1: Create data model
   Task 2: Use model to build API
   Task 3: Use API to write tests
   ```

2. **Context Isolation Needed**
   ```
   Task 1: Generate 10,000 lines of data
   Task 2: Analyze data (needs fresh context)
   ```

3. **Multi-Step Workflows**
   ```
   Research → Implement → Review → Deploy
   ```

### ❌ Don't Use cc_execute For

1. **Single Commands**: Just use Claude directly
2. **Simple Operations**: Direct execution is faster
3. **Shared State**: Tasks needing memory between them

## Implementation Examples

### Good: Multi-Step Workflow
```python
# Orchestrator manages the workflow
tasks = [
    "Create a FastAPI blog API with user authentication",
    "Add comprehensive test coverage to the blog API",
    "Generate OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints"
]

for task in tasks:
    # Each gets fresh 200K context
    result = execute_task_via_websocket(task, timeout=300)
    if not result["success"]:
        handle_failure(task, result)
```

### Bad: Single Task
```python
# DON'T DO THIS - Just use Claude directly!
result = execute_task_via_websocket("What is 2+2?")
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **No Additional Infrastructure**: Uses existing WebSocket handler
2. **Battle-Tested**: Already proven in production
3. **Self-Improving**: Prompts evolve with usage
4. **Clear Mental Model**: Orchestrator/Worker pattern is intuitive

## Conclusion

The prompt-based approach for cc_execute.md is the correct architecture for task list orchestration. MCP would add complexity without solving real problems in this context.

The system works exactly as intended:
- Orchestrator Claude manages workflows
- Worker Claudes get fresh context per task
- Sequential execution is guaranteed
- No unnecessary abstraction layers
