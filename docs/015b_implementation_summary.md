# Code Review 015b Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of code review feedback from 015b.

## Changes Implemented

### Medium Priority (◯)

#### N1: Per-hook timeout support in hook_integration.py
- ✅ Modified `execute_hook` to support both string and dict hook configurations
- ✅ Dict configurations can now specify `timeout` field with fallback to global timeout
- ✅ Example configuration:
  ```json
  {
    "hooks": {
      "simple-hook": "echo test",
      "complex-hook": {
        "command": "python long_running_script.py",
        "timeout": 120
      }
    },
    "timeout": 60  // Global fallback
  }
  ```

#### N2: Improved error propagation for pre-execute failures
- ✅ Enhanced error handling in `_handle_execute` to surface hook failures as warnings
- ✅ Added detailed warning notifications via WebSocket when hooks fail
- ✅ Special handling for "invalid command" errors with suggestions
- ✅ Notifications include:
  - `hook.warning`: General hook failure notification
  - `command.validation_warning`: Specific warning for invalid commands

### Low Priority (○) - Quick fixes

#### N3: Fixed Redis absence handling in analyze_command_complexity
- ✅ Separated `ImportError` from general exceptions
- ✅ Graceful fallback when Redis module is not installed
- ✅ Clear debug messages distinguish between missing module vs connection errors

#### N5: Updated SetupEnvironment docstring
- ✅ Enhanced docstring to reflect Path/shlex security improvements
- ✅ Documented key features including:
  - Path traversal for .venv finding
  - shlex.split for secure command parsing
  - Redis integration for environment data
  - Graceful error handling

#### N6: Downgraded hook command logging from INFO to DEBUG
- ✅ Changed `logger.info` to `logger.debug` for hook execution logs
- ✅ Reduces log verbosity in production

#### N7: Added executable validation using shutil.which
- ✅ Validates executables before attempting to run them
- ✅ Handles both relative commands (via PATH) and absolute paths
- ✅ Returns clear error messages when executables are not found
- ✅ Prevents execution of non-existent commands

#### N8: Added log truncation for large outputs
- ✅ Truncates stdout/stderr in logs to prevent log bloat
- ✅ Keeps full output in result object
- ✅ Configurable max length (10KB default)
- ✅ Shows output size in debug logs

### N4: Unit tests for security logic
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/unit/test_hook_integration_security.py`
  - Per-hook timeout configuration tests
  - Executable validation tests
  - Command parsing security tests
  - Redis fallback tests
  - Log truncation tests
  - Environment variable encoding tests

- ✅ Created error propagation tests in `tests/unit/test_websocket_error_propagation.py`
  - Hook failure notification tests
  - Multiple hook failure handling
  - Stderr truncation tests
  - Exception handling tests

- ✅ Created test runner script `tests/unit/run_security_tests.py`

## Testing

### Quick Validation
Run the validation script from the project root:
```bash
python3 validate_015b_changes.py
```

### Unit Tests
Run the security unit tests with:
```bash
cd tests/unit
python run_security_tests.py
```

Or individually:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_hook_integration_security.py -v
pytest tests/unit/test_websocket_error_propagation.py -v
```

### Validation Results
✅ All validation tests passed:
- Per-hook timeout configuration works correctly
- Executable validation prevents running non-existent commands
- Redis fallback handles missing module gracefully

## Example Hook Configuration

With the new features, hooks can be configured more flexibly:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "quick-check": "echo 'Quick validation'",
    "complex-analysis": {
      "command": "python /path/to/heavy_analysis.py",
      "timeout": 300
    },
    "code-review": {
      "command": "python review_changes.py",
      "timeout": 120
    }
  },
  "timeout": 60,
  "env": {
    "PYTHONPATH": "./src"
  }
}
```

## Security Improvements

### Command Injection Prevention
The implementation now uses `shlex.split()` to parse commands, preventing shell injection attacks. Commands like:
```bash
echo 'test'; rm -rf /
```
Are now parsed as separate arguments rather than executed as shell commands.

### Executable Validation
Before executing any hook command, the system now:
1. Checks if the executable exists using `shutil.which()`
2. Resolves relative commands to absolute paths
3. Validates absolute paths exist
4. Returns clear error messages for missing executables

### Robust Error Handling
- Redis import errors are handled separately from connection errors
- Large outputs are truncated in logs but preserved in results
- Hook failures are propagated as warnings without blocking execution

## WebSocket Notifications

New notification types for better error visibility:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "hook.warning",
  "params": {
    "hook_type": "pre-execute",
    "error": "Command not found: invalid_cmd",
    "stderr": "bash: invalid_cmd: command not found",
    "message": "Hook 'pre-execute' failed but execution will continue",
    "severity": "warning"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "command.validation_warning",
  "params": {
    "command": "invalid_cmd --help",
    "warning": "Command may be invalid or not found",
    "suggestion": "Check command syntax and availability"
  }
}
```
