# CC-Orchestration MCP Tools Summary

## Overview

The cc-orchestration MCP server provides intelligent task management tools for Claude orchestrators working with cc_executor. These tools help orchestrators make better decisions about task execution without directly executing tasks themselves.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Orchestration tools provide insights and recommendations, but don't execute tasks
2. **Intelligence Layer**: Help orchestrators understand task complexity and dependencies
3. **Monitoring Without Control**: Observe execution progress without interfering
4. **Learning from History**: Analyze past executions to improve future decisions

## Available Tools

### 1. check_websocket_status
- **Purpose**: Verify WebSocket server is running before starting tasks
- **Returns**: Server status, port, health info, and WebSocket URL
- **Usage**: Always call this first to ensure infrastructure is ready

### 2. get_task_complexity
- **Purpose**: Analyze individual task complexity
- **Returns**: Complexity score, recommendation (cc_execute.md vs direct), timeout suggestion
- **Intelligence**: 
  - Pattern matching for high/medium/low complexity indicators
  - Detects tasks needing isolation (creation, implementation, design)
  - Provides specific timeout recommendations

### 3. validate_task_list
- **Purpose**: Pre-flight validation of entire task list
- **Returns**: 
  - Total complexity score and time estimate
  - Warnings (too many complex tasks, long duration)
  - Dependency detection and recommendations
- **Benefits**: Catch issues before execution starts

### 4. suggest_execution_strategy
- **Purpose**: Generate optimal execution plan
- **Returns**:
  - Per-task execution method (cc_execute.md vs direct)
  - Parallelization opportunities
  - Optimization tips
  - Formatted strategy markdown
- **Intelligence**: Considers complexity, dependencies, and resource constraints

### 5. monitor_execution
- **Purpose**: Track running or recent executions
- **Returns**: Active sessions, recent activity, execution status
- **Use Cases**:
  - Check if tasks are still running
  - Debug stuck executions
  - Get real-time progress updates

### 6. get_execution_history
- **Purpose**: Analyze past execution patterns
- **Returns**: Recent executions with durations, success rates, statistics
- **Benefits**: Learn from past performance to improve future estimates

### 7. get_hook_status
- **Purpose**: Verify security hooks are active
- **Returns**: Hook configuration, UUID4 verification status, recent activity
- **Security**: Ensures cc_execute.md protection is enabled

## Workflow Example

```python
# 1. Pre-execution checks
status = check_websocket_status()
if status["status"] != "running":
    # Start server or handle error
    
# 2. Validate and plan
validation = validate_task_list(tasks)
strategy = suggest_execution_strategy(tasks)

# 3. Execute based on strategy
for task in strategy["tasks"]:
    if task["execution_method"] == "cc_execute.md":
        # Use cc_execute.md with isolation
    else:
        # Execute directly
        
    # Monitor progress
    monitor_execution()

# 4. Review results
history = get_execution_history()
# Adjust future strategies based on performance
```

## Benefits

1. **Intelligent Decision Making**: Orchestrators know which tasks need isolation vs direct execution
2. **Resource Optimization**: Appropriate timeouts and parallelization opportunities
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Pre-flight validation catches issues early
4. **Performance Insights**: Historical data improves future task planning
5. **Security Awareness**: Hook status ensures protection mechanisms are active

## Implementation Details

- **Port Configuration**: Uses CC_EXECUTOR_PORT env var (default 8005)
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging to `logs/mcp/` directory
- **Pattern-Based Analysis**: Uses regex patterns to classify task complexity
- **WebSocket Integration**: Monitors WebSocket logs for execution tracking

## Best Practices

1. **Always Check Status First**: Ensure WebSocket server is running
2. **Validate Before Execution**: Use validate_task_list for pre-flight checks
3. **Follow Strategy Recommendations**: Trust the complexity analysis
4. **Monitor Long Tasks**: Use monitor_execution for tasks over 5 minutes
5. **Learn from History**: Review execution_history to improve estimates

## Limitations

- **No Direct Execution**: These tools don't execute tasks, only provide insights
- **Log-Based Monitoring**: Relies on parsing logs for execution tracking
- **Pattern Matching**: Complexity analysis uses heuristics, not deep understanding
- **Requires WebSocket Server**: All monitoring depends on the WebSocket infrastructure

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning**: Train complexity models on actual execution data
2. **Real-time Streaming**: Direct WebSocket connection for live monitoring
3. **Dependency Graph**: Visual representation of task dependencies
4. **Resource Prediction**: Estimate CPU/memory requirements
5. **Failure Prediction**: Identify tasks likely to fail based on patterns

## Conclusion

The cc-orchestration MCP tools provide a powerful intelligence layer for task management. By separating orchestration insights from execution, they enable smarter, safer, and more efficient multi-step project execution. Orchestrators can make informed decisions while maintaining full control over the execution process.
