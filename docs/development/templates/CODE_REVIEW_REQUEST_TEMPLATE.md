## Best Practices for Code Reviews

### For Requesters
1. **Be Specific**: Point reviewers to areas of concern
2. **Test First**: Ensure all tests pass before requesting review
3. **Small PRs**: Keep changes focused and manageable
4. **Context**: Explain why changes were made, not just what

### For Reviewers
1. **Be Constructive**: Focus on improvements, not criticism
2. **Prioritize**: Distinguish between must-fix and nice-to-have
3. **Code Examples**: Provide examples for suggested changes
4. **Acknowledge Good Work**: Highlight what was done well

### Common Review Focuses

1. **Script Structure**
   - Functions in correct location (outside __main__)
   - Single asyncio.run() pattern enforced
   - Proper error handling with meaningful messages
   - No recursive imports or circular dependencies

2. **Project Patterns**
   - Logging with loguru (no print statements)
   - Redis for caching with graceful degradation
   - JSON output formatting (indent=2, sorted keys)
   - Results saved to tmp/responses/ with timestamps
   - OutputCapture pattern for consistent JSON output

3. **Async & Subprocess Handling**
   - Subprocess streams properly drained (critical!)
   - Process groups used for cleanup (os.setsid)
   - WebSocket blocking maintains sequential execution
   - Proper task cancellation and cleanup

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clear documentation with real examples
   - Consistent naming (no duplicate .txt files)
   - Testable code with assertions
   - No code duplication
   - Hook system properly integrated

5. **Critical Patterns**
   - Sequential execution preserved (no parallel)
   - Thread-safe singleton initialization
   - Deferred hook initialization to prevent crashes
   - Question format for cc_execute.md tasks

## Known Anti-Patterns to Check

### From Project Experience
1. **Subprocess Deadlock**: Not draining stdout/stderr when using PIPE
2. **Hook Initialization**: Initializing in __init__ causes server crashes
3. **Circular Imports**: CLI main.py calling itself via subprocess
4. **Multiple asyncio.run()**: Causes event loop conflicts
5. **Redis Without Check**: Assuming Redis is always available
6. **Print Instead of Logger**: Using print() for output
7. **Functions in __main__**: Logic mixed with test code
8. **Missing Process Cleanup**: Zombie processes from poor cleanup

## COMPREHENSIVE CODE-REVIEW ASSESSMENT PROCESS

When performing a code review for CC Executor, follow this rigorous assessment process:

### Scope

1. **Read the specified review-request markdown file in full**
   - No skimming - read every section thoroughly
   - Note all referenced files and changes

2. **Open every file it references and inspect them line-by-line**
   - Use Read tool to examine complete files
   - Track specific line numbers for issues

3. **Evaluate against the four Review Focus Areas:**
   
   a. **Template compliance (PYTHON_SCRIPT_TEMPLATE.md)**
      - Verify shebang, docstring, imports organization
      - Check function placement (outside `__main__`)
      - Validate single `asyncio.run()` pattern
      - Ensure proper logging with loguru
      - Confirm results saved to `tmp/responses/`
   
   b. **Report structure (TASK_LIST_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md)**
      - Verify all required sections present
      - Check raw JSON inclusion for each task
      - Validate anti-hallucination measures
      - Ensure proper timestamp and session tracking
   
   c. **Hook integration (pre/post hooks & sequential guarantees)**
      - Verify pre-flight checks run before execution
      - Confirm post-execution reports generated
      - Validate sequential execution maintained
      - Check hook configuration in `.claude-hooks.json`
   
   d. **Error-recovery patterns (simple, non-brittle)**
      - Ensure retry logic is straightforward
      - Verify no over-engineering
      - Check error tracking mechanisms
      - Validate known fixes documentation

### Deliverables (write to tasks/executor/incoming)

#### A. `NNN_<slug>_assessment.md`
Create a comprehensive assessment containing:
- **Strengths & weaknesses per focus area**
  - What's done well
  - What needs improvement
  - Missing elements
- **Exact file + line references for each issue**
  - E.g., "websocket_handler.py:234 - Missing error handling"
- **Impact analysis and overall verdict**
  - Critical/High/Medium/Low impact ratings
  - APPROVED/NEEDS_CHANGES/REJECTED verdict

#### B. Update or create `NNN_<slug>_fixes.json`
Create a task list with:
- **ONE task per finding, numbered 00N_**
- **Priority levels**: critical, high, medium, low
- **Component tags**: hooks, core, cli, client, docs
- **Keep tasks minimal, iterative, non-brittle**

Example structure:
```json
{
  "review_id": "021_comprehensive_project_review",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "001_fix_redis_timeout",
      "priority": "medium",
      "component": "hooks",
      "file": "task_list_completion_report.py",
      "line": 65,
      "issue": "Redis connection might hang",
      "fix": "Add connection timeout parameter"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rules

- **No skimming**: Cite real line numbers and actual code
- **Provide both deliverables**: Narrative assessment AND task list
- **Do not add complexity**: Keep fixes simple and targeted
- **Be specific**: Vague feedback helps no one
- **Consider impact**: Focus on what matters most
