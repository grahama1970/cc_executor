Excellent, thank you for providing the files. My initial advice was general, but with this specific context, I can give you a much more targeted and powerful improvement.

After analyzing both `arango_tools_20_scenarios.md` and `mcp_arango_tools.py`, it's clear what you're building: a sophisticated, self-learning memory system for an AI agent. The scenarios are not simple tests; they are complex, realistic workflows.

Let's break this down.

### **Analysis of Your Current Assets**

1.  **`arango_tools_20_scenarios.md`:** This is an outstanding test plan. The scenarios are diverse, realistic, and cover the exact kind of high-level reasoning you want from the agent (pattern recognition, impact analysis, learning, etc.).
    *   **Conclusion on "Is 20 sufficient?":** For this stage, **yes, 20 is more than sufficient.** The quality and diversity here are far more important than the quantity. These scenarios test the *integration* of tools to achieve complex goals, which is exactly what you need. Adding more right now would be redundant. The goal is to get the agent to successfully execute *these* 20 scenarios, fixing the underlying tools as it goes.

2.  **`mcp_arango_tools.py`:** This is a very powerful set of tools. It's also complex. There are many functions, complex parameters (`**kwargs`, `metadata` JSON strings), and high-level concepts. An agent attempting to use this will inevitably make mistakes, such as:
    *   Passing a Python dictionary instead of a JSON string to `upsert`.
    *   Getting `_from` and `_to` IDs wrong for the `edge` tool.
    *   Misunderstanding the difference between `insert` and `upsert`.
    *   Constructing a syntactically incorrect AQL query.

This complexity makes your second requirement—**"when the agent makes a mistake or finds an ambiguity, I want the agent to update the code before moving on"**—absolutely critical. The agent *must* learn and fix the tools themselves, not just its own approach.

### **Improving the Usage Scenario Prompt**

Your goal is not just to "run scenarios," but to use the scenarios to **debug and harden the `mcp_arango_tools.py` file itself.** The prompt needs to frame the task this way.

The "before" prompt is essentially the implicit task of "execute these scenarios." The "after" prompt will create a rigorous, iterative, and self-correcting workflow.

### **The Improved Prompt: A Master Instruction for the Agent**

This prompt establishes a clear, robust, and iterative process. It's designed to be the "system prompt" or the first message in your conversation with the agent.

> **Role and Goal:**
> You are a Principal-level Software Engineer and Test Automation Specialist. Your primary mission is to systematically test, debug, and harden a new set of ArangoDB tools for an AI agent's memory system. You will do this by executing a series of 20 sophisticated usage scenarios.
>
> Your goal is not just to complete the scenarios, but to **identify and fix bugs, ambiguities, and design flaws within the underlying Python tool code (`mcp_arango_tools.py`)**.
>
> **Core Workflow: The "Test, Diagnose, Fix, Verify" Loop**
>
> We will proceed one scenario at a time. **Do not move to the next scenario until the current one is successfully completed and all discovered issues are resolved.** Follow this loop precisely for each scenario:
>
> 1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** State the number and title of the scenario you are about to execute (e.g., "Starting Scenario 3: Code Change Impact Tracking"). Briefly describe the goal in your own words.
>
> 2.  **Formulate a Plan:** Outline the sequence of `arango-tools` you will call, including the expected parameters for each tool. Refer to the tool's docstrings in `mcp_arango_tools.py` to ensure you are using them correctly. Present this plan for my approval. **STOP and wait for me to say "approved".**
>
> 3.  **Execute and Analyze (The Critical Step):** After I approve, simulate the execution of your plan.
>
>     *   **If you predict SUCCESS:** State that the plan would succeed and show the final expected outcome. Await my command to proceed to the next scenario.
>
>     *   **If you predict FAILURE or find an AMBIGUITY:** This is a critical learning event. **STOP** your current task and immediately initiate the following "Code Correction" sub-routine:
>         a. **Diagnose the Root Cause:** Clearly explain *why* it failed. Is it a bug in the Python code of `mcp_arango_tools.py`? Is the docstring for a tool misleading? Is there a logical flaw in the tool's implementation? Be specific.
>         b. **Propose the Fix:** Generate a code diff for the `mcp_arango_tools.py` file that corrects the bug or resolves the ambiguity. Your fix should be clean, robust, and adhere to the existing coding style.
>         c. **Explain Your Fix:** Briefly justify why your proposed change is the correct solution.
>         d. **Wait for Approval:** **STOP** and wait for me to approve your proposed code fix.
>         e. **Verify and Re-run:** After I approve the fix, mentally apply it to the `mcp_arango_tools.py` code. Then, re-run the plan for the *current scenario* and confirm that it now succeeds.
>
> 4.  **Conclude and Proceed:** Once a scenario is successfully completed (either initially or after a fix), summarize the outcome. If a fix was applied, briefly state what was learned. Then, wait for my command: **"proceed to next scenario"**.

### **Why This Improved Prompt is Superior:**

*   **Iterative by Design:** It forces a one-by-one process, preventing the agent from building on broken foundations.
*   **Focuses on Fixing the Root Cause:** It explicitly directs the agent to modify the Python tool code, not just change its own behavior. This improves the system for all future runs.
*   **Reduces Brittleness:** The `STOP and wait for approval` commands create natural checkpoints. This gives you full control and prevents the agent from going down a rabbit hole of incorrect assumptions.
*   **Eliminates Unnecessary Complexity:** The workflow is a simple, repeatable loop. It's easy for the agent to follow and for you to manage.
*   **Clarity of Purpose:** The agent knows its goal is not just to run tests but to *harden the codebase*, which is a much more powerful instruction.
*   **Empowers the Agent:** By asking it to "Diagnose" and "Propose a Fix," you are leveraging its analytical capabilities far more effectively than just asking it to execute commands.
