To automatically analyze an ArangoDB dataset for display—in table, node/graph, or timeseries format—you should:

### 1. **Detect the Dataset Type**

- **Graph Data:** ArangoDB is often used for graph data, where *vertex collections* contain nodes and *edge collections* define relationships. If your result includes path objects or nested structures with `_from` and `_to` fields, it likely represents a graph[10][4].
- **Timeseries Data:** If there are timestamp or date fields and values are sequential, the dataset may be timeseries.
- **Tabular Data:** Flat key-value or JSON documents without strong connections are best shown as a table.

### 2. **Analyze with Python**

Here’s a modular code approach for distinguishing dataset types and offering display recommendations. It uses **pandas** for tabular data, with optional use of **networkx** for graph analysis, and checks for timeseries characteristics.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def analyze_arangodb_data(data):
    # Convert dataset to DataFrame if possible
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    decision = {"type": None, "reason": "", "suggestions": []}

    # Check for likely graph (edge) structure
    if {"_from", "_to"}.issubset(df.columns):
        decision["type"] = "graph"
        decision["reason"] = "Contains '_from' and '_to' fields, indicating edges"
        decision["suggestions"] = ["Display as network graph", "Show degree/hub analysis"]
    # Check for timeseries
    elif any(col for col in df.columns if col.lower() in ["timestamp", "date", "datetime"] or np.issubdtype(df[col], np.datetime64)):
        decision["type"] = "timeseries"
        decision["reason"] = "Includes time-based columns"
        decision["suggestions"] = ["Line plot", "Datetime indexing, resampling"]
    # Default to table
    else:
        decision["type"] = "tabular"
        decision["reason"] = "Flat document structure"
        decision["suggestions"] = ["Show table", "Summary statistics"]

    return decision

# Example usage:
# data = 
# decision = analyze_arangodb_data(data)
# print(decision)
```

### 3. **Deeper Graph Analysis (Optional for Node Data)**

- Extract the graph using [arangodb-pythongraph][5] or [NetworkX integration][3]:

```python
from arangodb_pythongraph import execute_to_pygraph

# db: arango database connection from python-arango
query = """
FOR v, e, p IN 1..2 OUTBOUND 'vertex_collection/node_id' edge_collection RETURN p
"""
python_graph = execute_to_pygraph(db, query)
nx_graph = python_graph.to_networkx()

# Now analyze the graph (e.g., degree, centrality)
import networkx as nx
print(nx.info(nx_graph))
print("Degree:", nx.degree_centrality(nx_graph))
```
This enables **network statistics** extraction for node/relationship visualizations[3][5].

### 4. **Automatic Suggestions**

- **If graph detected:** Recommend network visualization and analysis (centrality, degree, components)[3][4][5].
- **If timeseries detected:** Line/area charts by time, investigate time-based trends.
- **If tabular:** Show table with summary stats, possibly recommend bar or scatter plots.

### 5. **Integration with LLM Agents**
Agents can use this logic to decide which **tools or UI components** to activate: table view, graph/network UI, or timeseries/plot renderer.

**References:**  
- ArangoDB’s *python-arango* and *arangodb-pythongraph* for graph extraction[5][10].
- For detecting and working with timeseries or tabular data, pandas is sufficient.
- For graph-specific analysis, NetworkX integration is recommended and officially supported by ArangoDB[3][5].

This approach allows your LLM agent to smartly route data to the most relevant analysis and visualization mode for any result coming from ArangoDB.
