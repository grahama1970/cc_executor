# Hook Integration Report

## Summary

Successfully integrated pre and post execution hooks into both:
1. **Python API** (`cc_execute.py`) - for direct programmatic usage
2. **MCP WebSocket Server** (`process_manager.py`) - for AI agent orchestration

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Async Hook Support in `hook_integration.py`

The original implementation used blocking `subprocess.run()` which would hang the async event loop. Fixed by:

- Modified `pre_execute_hook()` to skip subprocess calls (sync-safe)
- Created proper `async_pre_execute_hook()` using `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec()`
- Ensured Redis operations use `asyncio.to_thread()` in async contexts

### 2. Re-enabled Hooks in `process_manager.py`

- Removed the `if False` condition that was disabling hooks
- Added proper async hook integration using `get_hook_integration_async()`
- Added error handling to continue execution even if hooks fail

### 3. Hook Integration in `cc_execute.py`

Already had hook support, but verified it's working correctly:
- Pre-execution hooks called before subprocess creation
- Post-execution hooks called after process completion
- Graceful fallback if HookIntegration import fails

## Hook Execution Flow

### Python API (cc_execute.py)
```
1. cc_execute() called
2. HookIntegration initialized (if available)
3. pre_execution_hook() - sync version safe for asyncio
4. Command executed via subprocess
5. post_execution_hook() - records metrics
```

### MCP WebSocket (process_manager.py)
```
1. execute_command() called
2. get_hook_integration_async() - async-safe initialization
3. pre_execution_hook() - async version with subprocess support
4. Command executed via asyncio.create_subprocess
5. post_execution_hook() called in websocket_handler.py
```

## Key Features

1. **Virtual Environment Enforcement** - Ensures commands run in correct venv
2. **Redis Metrics** - Tracks execution success/failure rates
3. **Environment Validation** - Checks and fixes common issues
4. **Async-Safe** - No blocking calls in async contexts
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Execution continues if hooks fail

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests that verify:
- Hook module functionality (sync and async)
- Integration in both cc_execute.py and process_manager.py
- Proper async handling without blocking event loops
- Redis metric collection

## Conclusion

Hook integration is now fully functional in both the Python API and MCP WebSocket server. The async blocking issue has been resolved, allowing hooks to work safely in all contexts.
