# CC Executor Docker Deployment

CC Executor is now ready for Docker deployment with a clean, organized structure.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd deployment
./deploy.sh
```

## What's Been Done

### 1. Project Organization
- ✅ Moved Docker files to `deployment/` directory
- ✅ Moved assessment reports to `assessments/` directory  
- ✅ Moved test scripts to `scratch/` directory
- ✅ Archived old logs to `logs/archive/`
- ✅ Cleaned up Python cache files

### 2. Docker Configuration
- ✅ Created production-ready `docker-compose.yml` with:
  - Redis for session persistence
  - WebSocket server (port 8003)
  - Optional REST API (port 8000)
  - Resource limits and health checks
  - Security best practices (non-root user, limited mounts)

### 3. Key Features
- **Safe Execution**: Isolated container environment
- **Session Persistence**: Redis-backed sessions survive restarts
- **Scalable**: Can run multiple instances behind load balancer
- **Monitoring**: Health endpoints and structured logging

### 4. Hook Clarification
- Added comments to `.claude-hooks.json` explaining it doesn't work
- CC Executor provides the working hook implementation

## Next Steps
1. Test the Docker deployment: `cd deployment && ./deploy.sh`
2. Verify services: `python test_deployment.py`
3. Consider publishing to PyPI for easier installation
