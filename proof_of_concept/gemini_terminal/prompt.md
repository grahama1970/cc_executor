# Gemini Stress Test Prompt

You are a skilled AI project architect.

Your task is to simulate an entire year-long global product launch plan.

In this simulation, there are:

- 6 regional offices:
  - North America
  - Europe
  - Asia
  - South America
  - Africa
  - Australia

- 20 cross-functional stakeholders:
  - Executives
  - Engineers
  - Designers
  - Sales
  - Support

- 50 unique product features launching across multiple timelines

---

## Instructions

1. Break down the plan into 4 quarters (Q1 to Q4).
2. For each quarter, define **3‚Äì5 major milestones**.
3. For each milestone, define the following:
   - A short description
   - Start and end dates
   - Assigned leads
   - Dependencies and region(s) affected
   - Estimated effort in person-weeks

4. After establishing the quarterly plans:
   - Generate a matrix of responsibility showing which stakeholders are involved in which milestones.
   - Include a **JSON summary** for each regional office showing:
     - Total milestones owned
     - Total effort (in person-weeks)
     - Features covered

5. Return **only the output as a complete JSON object**.

If output is too large, begin with Q1 and stream the remaining quarters.
