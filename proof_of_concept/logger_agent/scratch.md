 No, I'm not in an error spiral. Here's the current
  status:

  What I've Done:

  1. Created a proof-of-concept FixCodeWithEscalation tool
  that intelligently escalates through:
    - Self-fix attempts
    - Perplexity research (for low complexity)
    - Fresh Claude via cc_execute (for medium/high
  complexity)
    - Gemini via LiteLLM (for persistent issues)
  2. Migrated all tools from .claude/tools/ to src/tools/
  for better organization
  3. Updated tools.json to point to the new locations
  4. Added proper script headers with dependencies to:
    - fix_code_with_escalation.py (added litellm, loguru,
  python-dotenv)
    - query_agent_logs.py (added python-arango,
  python-dotenv, loguru)
    - analyze_agent_performance.py (added python-arango,
  python-dotenv, loguru)
  5. Made all tools executable with chmod +x

  Current State:

  All tools are now:
  - In src/tools/ directory
  - Registered in tools.json
  - Have proper #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script headers
  - Include their dependencies
  - Are executable

  The escalation tool is ready to use and follows the best
  practices we researched with Perplexity.
