# CC Executor Hook Integration Complete

**Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Status**: Ready to Use

## What Was Set Up

### 1. Created `.claude/settings.json` in CC Executor

The correct location according to Claude Code documentation is:
```
/home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/.claude/settings.json
```

This file contains hook configurations for:
- **PreToolUse**: Captures when tools are about to be used
- **PostToolUse**: Captures tool results after execution  
- **Notification**: Captures user notifications
- **Stop**: Captures when Claude completes a response
- **SubagentStop**: Captures when subagents complete

### 2. Hook Commands

Each hook runs the Logger Agent's `send_event.py` script with appropriate parameters:

```bash
uv run /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/proof_of_concept/logger_agent/.claude/hooks/send_event.py \
  --source-app cc-executor \
  --event-type PreToolUse
```

## How It Works

1. When you run Claude Code in the CC Executor directory, it checks `.claude/settings.json`
2. For each event type (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.), it runs the configured hook command
3. The hook script sends event data to the Logger Agent Dashboard API
4. Events are stored in ArangoDB with graph relationships
5. The Vue dashboard displays events in real-time

## Testing the Integration

### 1. Start Logger Agent Dashboard

```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/proof_of_concept/logger_agent
./scripts/start_dashboard_background.sh
```

### 2. Verify Dashboard is Running

```bash
./scripts/status_dashboard.sh
```

### 3. Run Claude Code in CC Executor

```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor
claude "list the files in the current directory"
```

### 4. View Events

Open http://localhost:5173 and watch events appear in real-time!

## Event Data Captured

### PreToolUse
- Tool name (Bash, Read, Write, etc.)
- Tool input parameters
- Session ID
- Timestamp

### PostToolUse  
- Tool execution results
- Exit codes
- Output data
- Execution duration

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Appearing?

1. Check API server logs:
```bash
tail -f /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/proof_of_concept/logger_agent/logs/dashboard/api_server.log
```

2. Test hook manually:
```bash
echo '{"tool_name": "test", "session_id": "test123"}' | \
uv run /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/proof_of_concept/logger_agent/.claude/hooks/send_event.py \
  --source-app cc-executor --event-type PreToolUse
```

3. Verify `.claude/settings.json` exists:
```bash
cat /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/.claude/settings.json
```

## Next Steps

1. Monitor CC Executor activity in real-time
2. Use BM25 search to find specific operations
3. Analyze execution patterns with graph visualization
4. Track errors and their resolutions
5. Build insights from agent behavior

The hooks are now properly configured to send all Pre and Post tool events to the Logger Agent Dashboard!
