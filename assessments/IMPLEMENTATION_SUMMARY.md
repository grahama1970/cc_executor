# CC Executor Implementation Summary

Date: 2025-01-04

## All Tasks Completed âœ…

All features claimed in the README.md have been implemented and tested:

### 1. âœ… Redis-backed Session State (`session_manager.py`)
- Fully implemented Redis support with automatic fallback to in-memory
- Session data stored in Redis with TTL
- WebSocket references kept in memory for performance
- Comprehensive test in `__main__` block tests both Redis and in-memory modes

### 2. âœ… Token Limit Detection (`websocket_handler.py`)
- Enhanced token limit detection with multiple patterns:
  - "Claude's response exceeded the"
  - "maximum context length"
  - "context length exceeded"
  - "output token maximum"
  - "This model's maximum context length is"
  - "reduce the length of the messages"
- Sends special notification when token limits are detected
- Extracts token limit values when possible

### 3. âœ… README.md Updated
- Hook architecture section updated to reflect actual implementation:
  - `hook_integration.py` - Main hook integration (ProgrammaticHookEnforcement)
  - `setup_environment.py` - Environment setup hooks
  - `record_execution_metrics.py` - Execution metrics recording
  - `review_code_changes.py` - Code review hooks
- Redis session state description updated
- Token limit detection description enhanced

### 4. âœ… All `__main__` Test Blocks Verified
- `session_manager.py` - Tests Redis and in-memory modes
- `process_manager.py` - Already had comprehensive tests
- `stream_handler.py` - Already had comprehensive tests  
- `resource_monitor.py` - Already had comprehensive tests

### 5. âœ… End-to-End Verification
Created `test_cc_executor_features.py` that verifies:
- Shell configuration (zsh default)
- UUID4 hooks (pre and post execution)
- Redis session state
- Token limit detection patterns
- Hook architecture files
- CLI commands
- WebSocket server (optional)

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
- âœ… Shell configuration working (zsh found)
- âœ… UUID4 hooks inject and verify correctly
- âœ… Redis connection established and working
- âœ… Token limit patterns detected correctly
- âœ… All hook files exist
- âœ… CLI commands functional

## Deployment Status

**CC Executor is ready for deployment!** ðŸš€

All features claimed in the README are implemented, tested, and verified to work correctly.
