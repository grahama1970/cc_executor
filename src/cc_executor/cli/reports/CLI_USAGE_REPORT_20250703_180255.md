## Hook Integration Summary

✅ Hooks were available and used for:

- Dependency checking
- Execution metrics recording


## Recommendations

### For Failed Components:

- **main.py**: Review usage function for proper demonstration

### Recommended CLI Pattern:
For AI-friendly CLI components:
- Place usage examples directly in `if __name__ == '__main__':`
- Avoid complex argparse for basic demonstrations
- Show real CLI operations with immediate execution
- Self-validate outputs without string matching
