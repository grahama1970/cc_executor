## Independent Verification Commands

Run these commands yourself to verify:

```bash
# List actual files on disk
ls -la src/cc_executor/client/tmp/responses/cc_execute_*.json | tail -10

# Check file contents directly
tail -5 src/cc_executor/client/tmp/responses/cc_execute_*.json | head -50

# Verify with jq
for f in src/cc_executor/client/tmp/responses/cc_execute_*.json; do
    echo "=== $f ==="
    jq -r '.execution_uuid + " | " + .task' "$f" 2>/dev/null | head -5
done
```

## Conclusion

✅ **VERIFIED**: These results are real and exist on disk.
