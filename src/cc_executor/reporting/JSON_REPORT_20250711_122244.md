TRANSFORMATION INSTRUCTIONS:
For EACH section in the batch, apply these rules EXACTLY:

1.  **MERGE CONTIGUOUS TEXT:**
    - Combine ALL sequential 'Text' blocks into a single 'Text' block.
    - Use a double newline '\n\n' to separate the content of the original blocks, preserving paragraph structure.

2.  **FORMAT TABLES FOR PANDAS:**
    - For each 'Table' block, the 'text' field MUST be a JSON-escaped string containing an array of objects.
    - Each object in the array represents a single table row, with headers as keys.
    - **Example Format:** `"text": "[{\"Signal\":\"clk_i\",\"IO\":\"in\"},{\"Signal\":\"rst_ni\",\"IO\":\"in\"}]"`
    - Before creating the JSON, fix split words in table headers (e.g., "Descripti on" -> "Description").

3.  **ENRICH FIGURES:**
    - For each 'Figure' block, ensure it has the keys: 'caption', 'image_url', and 'description'.
    - Set 'caption' to 'Figure'.
    - If 'image_url' is missing or empty, you MUST set it to the literal string 'dummy_image_url'.
    - Write a detailed 'description' of what the figure shows based on its context within the document.

4.  **FIX FALSE HEADERS:**
    - Identify blocks mislabeled as 'SectionHeader' that are actually text content (e.g., "For any HW configuration,", "As DebugEn = False,").
    - Change their 'block_type' to 'Text'.
    - **Crucially, merge these newly converted Text blocks with the immediately following text or list item block.**

RETURN SCHEMA:
Return a single, valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    "sections": [
        {
            "section_id": <number>,
            "fixes_applied": {
                "tables_merged": <count>,
                "figures_grouped": <count>,

            },
            "blocks": [

            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Process ALL 1 sections provided in the BATCH DATA.
- Return ALL blocks for each section, including unmodified ones, in their original order.
- The output MUST strictly adhere to the schemas and instructions provided.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the entire section for context
2. Identify and fix any extraction artifacts (split words, missing spaces)
3. Analyze tables - decide if any should be merged based on content
4. Identify false headers and reclassify appropriately
5. Parse tables into clean JSON format
6. Track all fixes applied
