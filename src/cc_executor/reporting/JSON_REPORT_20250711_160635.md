Fix multiple PDF sections by applying the following transformations with absolute precision.

}
```

TRANSFORMATION INSTRUCTIONS:
For EACH section in the batch, apply these rules EXACTLY:

1.  **MERGE CONTIGUOUS TEXT:**
    - Combine ALL sequential 'Text' blocks into a single 'Text' block.
    - Use a double newline '\n\n' to separate the content of the original blocks, preserving paragraph structure.

2.  **FORMAT TABLES FOR PANDAS:**
    - For each 'Table' block, the 'text' field MUST be a JSON-escaped string containing an array of objects.
    - Each object in the array represents a single table row, with headers as keys.
    - **Example Format:** `"text": "[{\"Signal\":\"clk_i\",\"IO\":\"in\"},{\"Signal\":\"rst_ni\",\"IO\":\"in\"}]"`
    - Before creating the JSON, fix split words in table headers (e.g., "Descripti on" -> "Description").

3.  **ENRICH FIGURES:**
    - For each 'Figure' block, ensure it has the keys: 'caption', 'image_url', and 'description'.
    - Set 'caption' to 'Figure'.
    - If 'image_url' is missing or empty, you MUST set it to the literal string 'dummy_image_url'.
    - Write a detailed 'description' of what the figure shows based on its context within the document.

4.  **FIX FALSE HEADERS:**
    - Identify blocks mislabeled as 'SectionHeader' that are actually text content (e.g., "For any HW configuration,", "As DebugEn = False,").
    - Change their 'block_type' to 'Text'.
    - **Crucially, merge these newly converted Text blocks with the immediately following text or list item block.**

RETURN SCHEMA:
Return a single, valid JSON object with this exact structure:

    "sections": [
        {
            "section_id": <number>,

Fix the timeout issue in /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/src/cc_executor/client/cc_execute.py.

The problem: When the Claude CLI produces lots of output, it fills the OS pipe buffer (64KB) and blocks waiting for space. The current code waits for proc.wait() before ensuring the output is being read, causing a deadlock.

Current problematic code (around line 348-363):
```python
# Wait for process completion with timeout
try:
    await asyncio.wait_for(
        proc.wait(),  # This waits for process exit
        timeout=config.timeout
    )
    # Only THEN reads output - too late!
    await stdout_task
    await stderr_task
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    stdout_task.cancel()
    stderr_task.cancel()
    raise
```

The fix needed:
1. Use asyncio.gather() to wait for BOTH proc.wait() AND the read tasks simultaneously
2. On timeout, don't raise - return partial results
3. Ensure output is being actively read while the process runs

Please implement the fix in the _execute_claude_command function to prevent output buffer deadlock.
```

**JSON Response**:
```json
{
  "result": "The timeout issue has already been fixed in the code. The implementation now uses asyncio.gather() to wait for both process completion and output reading tasks simultaneously, preventing the 64KB buffer deadlock. On timeout, it returns partial results instead of raising an exception.",

TRANSFORMATION INSTRUCTIONS:
For EACH section in the batch, apply these rules EXACTLY:

1.  **MERGE CONTIGUOUS TEXT:**
    - Combine ALL sequential 'Text' blocks into a single 'Text' block.
    - Use a double newline '\n\n' to separate the content of the original blocks, preserving paragraph structure.

2.  **FORMAT TABLES FOR PANDAS:**
    - For each 'Table' block, the 'text' field MUST be a JSON-escaped string containing an array of objects.
    - Each object in the array represents a single table row, with headers as keys.
    - **Example Format:** `"text": "[{\"Signal\":\"clk_i\",\"IO\":\"in\"},{\"Signal\":\"rst_ni\",\"IO\":\"in\"}]"`
    - Before creating the JSON, fix split words in table headers (e.g., "Descripti on" -> "Description").

3.  **ENRICH FIGURES:**
    - For each 'Figure' block, ensure it has the keys: 'caption', 'image_url', and 'description'.
    - Set 'caption' to 'Figure'.
    - If 'image_url' is missing or empty, you MUST set it to the literal string 'dummy_image_url'.
    - Write a detailed 'description' of what the figure shows based on its context within the document.

4.  **FIX FALSE HEADERS:**
    - Identify blocks mislabeled as 'SectionHeader' that are actually text content (e.g., "For any HW configuration,", "As DebugEn = False,").
    - Change their 'block_type' to 'Text'.
    - **Crucially, merge these newly converted Text blocks with the immediately following text or list item block.**

RETURN SCHEMA:
Return a single, valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
    "sections": [
        {
            "section_id": <number>,
            "fixes_applied": {

            },

            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}

IMPORTANT:
- Process ALL 1 sections provided in the BATCH DATA.
- Return ALL blocks for each section, including unmodified ones, in their original order.
- The output MUST strictly adhere to the schemas and instructions provided.
