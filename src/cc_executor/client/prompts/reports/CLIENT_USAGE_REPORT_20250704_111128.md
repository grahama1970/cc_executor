## Recommendations

### Maintain Current Excellence:
- Continue using OutputCapture pattern for all usage functions
- Keep functions outside __main__ blocks
- Ensure proper module naming (cc_executor.client.*)

### Client-Specific Notes:
- Client is a standalone WebSocket client that connects to existing server
- Does not manage its own server lifecycle
- Connection errors are expected when server is not running


## Anti-Hallucination Verification
