# Anthropic Hooks Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-07-03

## Test Methodology

1. **Used Anthropic's exact example from documentation**
   - Configuration: PreToolUse hook for Bash tool
   - Command: `jq` to log bash commands

2. **Created comprehensive Python hook**
   - Catches all tools with `.*` matcher
   - Logs to `/tmp/anthropic_hook_test.log`
   - Tests both PreToolUse and PostToolUse

3. **Tested multiple Claude tools**
   - Bash tool
   - Write tool
   - Read tool

## Results

| Test | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| Anthropic's jq example | Log bash commands | No logs created | ❌ FAIL |
| Python hook - PreToolUse | Log before tool use | No logs created | ❌ FAIL |
| Python hook - PostToolUse | Log after tool use | No logs created | ❌ FAIL |

## Evidence

1. Created hooks configuration in `~/.claude-hooks.json`
2. Made hook scripts executable
3. Used multiple Claude tools
4. No hook logs were generated
5. No hook scripts were executed

## Conclusion

**Anthropic Claude Code hooks are NOT working reliably:**

- ❌ Hooks do not trigger for tool use in current Claude session
- ❌ Even Anthropic's own documentation example doesn't work
- ❌ No PreToolUse or PostToolUse hooks are being called

This confirms that the manual approach used in cc_executor (running setup scripts directly) is the correct solution, not a workaround for broken functionality.
