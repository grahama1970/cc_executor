=== Claude Code Hook Test Demo ===

✅ Hooks configured at: /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/.claude-hooks.json
✅ Pre-execute hooks include setup_environment.py

1. Testing: Running Python command (should trigger pre-execute hook)
   Command output: Hello from Python
   ❌ Hook did NOT trigger

2. Testing: Running setup_environment.py manually
   ✅ Hook works when run manually!

=== CONCLUSION ===
Claude Code hooks are broken - they don't trigger automatically.
Our workaround in websocket_handler.py is the only solution.

CLAUDE CODE HOOKS - CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING
============================================================

What I got WRONG:
- I thought hooks trigger on ANY subprocess command ❌
- I was testing with regular Python/shell commands ❌
- I was expecting hooks to intercept subprocess.run() calls ❌

What hooks ACTUALLY do:
- Hooks trigger when CLAUDE uses tools (Bash, Edit, Read, etc.) ✅
- They intercept Claude's tool use, not general subprocess calls ✅
- They receive JSON data about the tool use via stdin ✅

This means:
1. Our original tests were testing the wrong thing
2. Hooks only work within Claude's tool-use context
3. For cc_executor (which runs subprocess directly), hooks are irrelevant
4. The "workaround" in websocket_handler.py is not a workaround - it's the correct approach

The cc_executor project needs to run setup scripts befo...[truncated]

1. Checking hooks configuration...

2. Testing if hooks trigger on simple commands...

   ❌ No marker file created (hooks didn't run)

SUMMARY
============================================================

Automatic hook triggering:
  - Pre-execute hook: ❌ Does NOT trigger
  - Post-execute hook: ❌ Does NOT trigger

Manual hook execution:
  - Pre-execute hook: ✅ Works when run manually
  - Post-execute hook: ✅ Works when run manually

Conclusion:
  Claude Code hooks are completely broken.
  The only solution is to manually run hooks in our code.

This is exactly what we do in websocket_handler.py!

## Recommendations

### For Failed Hooks:

- **test_claude_hooks_debug.py**: Pre-hooks executed: ['setup_environment', 'check_dependencies']

### Pattern Recommendation:
Hooks use --test flags for production safety, but for new non-hook components:
- Use direct `if __name__ == '__main__':` implementation
- No flags needed for simpler AI agent interaction
- See core/ components for AI-friendly patterns
