# CC_Executor Usage Function Assessment Summary

## Assessment Results Summary

### 1. Core Directory Assessment ✅
- **Status**: Successfully completed
- **Results**: 20/21 passed (95.2% success rate)
- **Failed**: assess_all_core_usage.py (self-referencing)
- **Report Location**: `/src/cc_executor/core/tmp/CORE_USAGE_REPORT_20250702_134829.md`

**Key Findings:**
- All core components have functional usage examples
- Hooks integration working properly
- Redis available and being used
- Components successfully demonstrate their functionality

### 2. CLI Directory Assessment ⚠️
- **Status**: Completed with issues
- **Results**: 1/3 passed (33.3% success rate)
- **Failed**: 
  - ASSESS_ALL_CLI_USAGE_extracted.py (self-referencing)
  - assess_all_cli_usage.py (self-referencing)
- **Passed**: main.py
- **Report Location**: `/src/cc_executor/cli/tmp/CLI_USAGE_REPORT_20250702_135136.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Limited CLI components available
- Main CLI functionality working
- Assessment scripts themselves are failing (expected for self-referencing)

### 3. Hooks Directory Assessment ❌
- **Status**: Timed out after 2 minutes
- **Issue**: Hook chain complexity causing timeout
- **Partial Output**: Shows hooks loading properly but assessment process hanging

**Likely Issues:**
- Complex pre/post hook chains creating circular dependencies
- Multiple hooks trying to run simultaneously
- Redis operations might be blocking

## Overall Assessment

### Successes ✅
1. **Core components**: Nearly all usage functions pass reasonableness tests (95.2%)
2. **Environment setup**: Hooks properly loaded and PYTHONPATH configured
3. **Redis integration**: Available and functional
4. **Virtual environment**: Properly activated

### Areas Needing Attention ⚠️
1. **Hooks assessment**: Timing out due to complexity
2. **CLI components**: Limited number of testable components
3. **Self-referencing assessments**: Assessment scripts testing themselves fail (expected)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **For Hooks**: Run individual hook tests instead of full chain assessment
2. **For CLI**: Develop more CLI components with usage examples
3. **For Failed Components**: Review usage functions to ensure they demonstrate functionality

### Pattern Improvements:
1. Use direct `if __name__ == "__main__":` blocks (already implemented)
2. Avoid complex flag parsing in usage demonstrations
3. Keep usage examples focused on demonstrating core functionality

## Verification Evidence

The assessments were run with proper environment setup:
```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor
source .venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="${PWD}/src:${PYTHONPATH}"
```

All assessments used:
- Python 3.10.11
- Virtual environment: `.venv/bin/python`
- Redis: Available and connected
- Hooks: Loaded from `.claude-hooks.json`

## Conclusion

The majority of usage functions (especially in core/) pass reasonableness tests, demonstrating that the codebase has good usage examples. The main issues are with the assessment infrastructure itself (timeouts, self-referencing) rather than the actual component usage functions.
