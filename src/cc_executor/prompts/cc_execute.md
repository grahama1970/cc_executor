## üèõÔ∏è ARCHITECT'S BRIEFING (Immutable)

### 1. Purpose
Enable the Claude Orchestrator to spawn fresh Claude instances (each with 200K context) for individual tasks, using bidirectional WebSocket communication to handle long-running tasks reliably, with automatic anti-hallucination verification.

### 2. Core Principles & Constraints
- Each task gets a fresh Claude instance with full 200K context
- **Bidirectional WebSocket prevents timeouts on long-running tasks**
- WebSocket handler ensures sequential execution (Task 2 waits for Task 1)
- No context pollution between tasks
- **Automatic UUID4 hooks for anti-hallucination verification (ALWAYS enabled)**
- Heartbeats keep connection alive during 30-60s Claude "thinking" periods
- Simple interface - just build command and execute

### 3. API Contract & Dependencies
- **Input**: Task description from orchestrator
- **Output**: Task execution results with hook verification status
- **Dependency**: websocket_handler.py manages the execution
- **Hooks**: Pre/post execution hooks automatically applied

## ü§ñ IMPLEMENTER'S WORKSPACE

### **Implementation Approach**

When the orchestrator needs Task N executed with a fresh Claude instance:

1. **Import the utility module**: `from cc_execute_utils import execute_task_via_websocket`
2. **Parse the task** from the orchestrator's request
3. **Build variables** (task description, timeout, tools list)
4. **Call the function** which internally:
   - Applies pre-hooks (UUID4 injection for anti-hallucination)
   - Calls `./core/websocket_handler.py`
   - Applies post-hooks (UUID4 verification)
5. **Return results** to the orchestrator with verification status

The implementation is in `cc_execute_utils.py` which handles:
- **Automatic pre-hooks**: Inject UUID4 requirements into task
- Building the Claude command with appropriate flags
- Calling websocket_handler.py as a subprocess
- Capturing and returning the output
- **Automatic post-hooks**: Verify UUID4 presence in output

Example usage:
```python
from cc_execute_utils import execute_task_via_websocket

# When orchestrator needs Task N executed
result = execute_task_via_websocket(
    task="Create a FastAPI app with a health endpoint",
    timeout=120,
    tools=["Write", "Edit"]
)

# Result contains success status, output, exit code, AND hook verification
print(f"Task {'succeeded' if result['success'] else 'failed'}")
print(f"UUID verified: {result['hook_verification']['verification_passed']}")
```

### **Task Execution Plan & Log**

#### **Step 1: Understand the Pattern**
*   **Goal:** Understand how websocket_handler.py executes commands
*   **Action:** Examined websocket_handler.py __main__ block
*   **Verification:** Identified it builds Claude commands and uses ProcessManager
*   **Expected Output:** Clear pattern for execution

**--- EXECUTION LOG (Step 1) ---**
```text
‚úÖ websocket_handler.py uses ProcessManager to execute Claude commands
‚úÖ Commands are built with -p flag and stream-json output format
‚úÖ Virtual environment and hooks are configured before execution
```
---

#### **Step 2: Create Utility Module**
*   **Goal:** Create cc_execute_utils.py to handle execution
*   **Action:** Extracted execution logic to separate Python file
*   **Verification:** Module created with execute_task_via_websocket function
*   **Expected Output:** Reusable utility module

**--- EXECUTION LOG (Step 2) ---**
```text
‚úÖ Created cc_execute_utils.py with subprocess-based execution
‚úÖ Function builds Claude command and calls websocket_handler.py
‚úÖ Returns structured results to orchestrator
```
---

#### **Step 3: Simplify Prompt**
*   **Goal:** Update cc_execute.md to reference utility module
*   **Action:** Removed embedded Python code, added usage examples
*   **Verification:** Prompt now follows template format
*   **Expected Output:** Clean prompt that references external implementation

**--- EXECUTION LOG (Step 3) ---**
```text
‚úÖ Removed embedded Python code from prompt
‚úÖ Added clear usage examples referencing cc_execute_utils.py
‚úÖ Prompt now serves as documentation for orchestrators
```

## üéì GRADUATION & VERIFICATION

### Key Insight
This prompt enables the orchestrator pattern by following websocket_handler.py's established execution flow, ensuring each task gets a fresh Claude instance with proper sequential control and automatic anti-hallucination verification.

### What This Achieves
1. **Fresh Context**: Each task starts with 200K tokens
2. **Sequential Execution**: WebSocket handler ensures order
3. **Anti-Hallucination**: Automatic UUID4 verification prevents fabricated results
4. **Simple Interface**: Orchestrator just calls this function - hooks work transparently
5. **Proven Pattern**: Reuses websocket_handler's tested approach with enhanced verification
