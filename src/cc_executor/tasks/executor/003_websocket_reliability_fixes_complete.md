# Fixes Complete for WebSocket Reliability

**Review ID**: 003_websocket_reliability  
**Date completed**: 2025-06-25  
**All fixes implemented**: ✅

## Summary
- Fixed 6 critical/major issues
- All tests implemented and verified
- Ready for re-review or production

## Fixes Applied

1. **Session Locking** (CRITICAL) ✅
   - Added asyncio.Lock() for thread-safe SESSIONS access
   - Prevents KeyError crashes under concurrent load

2. **Session Limit** (CRITICAL) ✅
   - Enforces MAX_SESSIONS=100
   - Rejects connections when limit reached

3. **Stream Timeout** (CRITICAL) ✅
   - 5-minute timeout on output streaming
   - Prevents hanging sessions from silent processes

4. **Control Flow Bug** (MAJOR) ✅
   - Fixed else block attachment
   - Properly handles unknown control types

5. **Partial Lines** (MAJOR) ✅
   - Handles lines exceeding buffer limits
   - Truncates with "..." marker

6. **CancelledError** (MAJOR) ✅
   - Removed re-raise to allow cleanup
   - Ensures proper resource cleanup

## Critical Corrections to O3's Review

### ❌ O3 ERROR - Fix #1 Was Incorrect
**O3 suggested**: `os.killpg(-pgid, signal.SIGTERM)` with negative PID
**Error encountered**: `OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument`
**Correct implementation**: `os.killpg(pgid, signal.SIGTERM)` with positive PID

This was verified using perplexity-ask which confirmed:
- `os.killpg()` requires a positive process group ID
- The negative PID syntax is NOT valid for this function
- When using `preexec_fn=os.setsid`, the child's PID becomes the PGID

### Implementation Notes

### Buffer Handling
Rather than reading byte-by-byte (inefficient), used asyncio's LimitOverrunError
to detect and handle oversized lines gracefully.

### Testing
Comprehensive test suite created covering all fix scenarios.
All fixes verified to solve the actual problems identified.
