      "file": "tests/stress/unified_stress_test_executor_v3.py",
      "line": 99,
      "issue": "Executor just echoes a marker instead of invoking Claude, so no real LLM output is produced and pattern checks always fail.",
      "fix": "Replace the placeholder echo logic with a real call to the local Claude CLI.  Use: `await websocket.send(json.dumps(cmd))` where `cmd` is the JSON payload already present in the task.  Remove the intermediate shell call entirely.",
      "verification": "Run `python tests/stress/unified_stress_test_executor_v3.py src/cc_executor/tasks/haiku_single_task.json` and confirm response length > 500 and at least 3 expected patterns are found."

      "line": 150,
      "issue": "Transcript verification is performed but failure does not mark the task as failed (PARTIALLY_FIXED).",
      "fix": "After calling `verify_in_transcript`, if verification fails set `task_result['success']=False` and append an error message so summary reflects failure.",
      "verification": "Intentionally set an impossible marker, run the test, and confirm the JSON summary marks `success:false`."

      "line": 239,
      "issue": "Missing `execution_config` triggers KeyError; quick patch added but we should provide sensible defaults and CLI override.",
      "fix": "Define `self.execution_config = self.tasks.get('execution_config', {\"max_concurrent\":5, \"retry\":2})` in `__init__` and reference it throughout.  Allow `--max-concurrent` CLI arg to override.",
      "verification": "Run with a task JSON that lacks execution_config and ensure no crash; pass `--max-concurrent 1` and see single-task batches."
