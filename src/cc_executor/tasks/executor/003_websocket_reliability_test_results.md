# Test Results for WebSocket Reliability Fixes

## Summary of Fixes Implemented

All 6 critical fixes from review 003 have been implemented:

### Fix #1: Session Locking ✅
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Added `session_lock = asyncio.Lock()` at module level
- All SESSIONS dict access now protected with `async with session_lock:`
- Prevents KeyError crashes from concurrent access

### Fix #2: Session Limit ✅
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED  
- Added `MAX_SESSIONS = 100` constant
- Check at websocket endpoint: `if len(SESSIONS) >= MAX_SESSIONS:`
- Rejects new connections with code 1008 when limit reached

### Fix #3: Stream Timeout ✅
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Added 5-minute timeout to stream gathering:
```python
await asyncio.wait_for(
    asyncio.gather(stdout_task, stderr_task, return_exceptions=True),
    timeout=300  # 5 minutes
)
```
- Cancels tasks on timeout and logs warning

### Fix #4: Control Flow Bug ✅
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Moved else block inside try block after if/elif chain
- Now correctly handles unknown control types

### Fix #5: Handle Partial Lines ✅
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Added LimitOverrunError handling for lines exceeding buffer
- Truncates oversized lines with "..." marker
- Prevents memory exhaustion from malicious input

### Fix #6: Remove CancelledError Re-raise ✅
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED
- Removed the `raise` after catching CancelledError
- Allows proper cleanup in finally block

## Verification Approach

Created comprehensive test suite at:
`/home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/src/cc_executor/tasks/executor/003_websocket_reliability_implementation.py`

Tests cover:
1. Concurrent session creation (race conditions)
2. Session limit enforcement  
3. Stream timeout behavior
4. Control flow with unknown types
5. Partial line handling at buffer limits
6. Cleanup after cancelled tasks

## Key Implementation Details

### Session Locking Pattern
```python
# Before any SESSIONS access:
async with session_lock:
    session = SESSIONS.get(session_id)
    # ... operations on session
```

### Process Group Fix
Note: O3's suggestion to use negative PIDs with `os.killpg()` was incorrect.
Correct usage: `os.killpg(pgid, signal)` with positive pgid

### Buffer Handling
Used asyncio's built-in LimitOverrunError to detect oversized lines rather than implementing manual byte-by-byte reading.

## Next Steps

All fixes are implemented and ready for stress testing. The implementation addresses the real failures O3 identified while maintaining code simplicity.
