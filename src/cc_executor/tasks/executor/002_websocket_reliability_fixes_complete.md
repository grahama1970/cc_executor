**Review ID**: 002_websocket_reliability  
**Date completed**: 2025-06-25  
**All fixes implemented**: ✓

## Summary

- Fixed 8 critical/major issues from second review
- Fixed 4 issues from first review (already in implementation.py)
- Total: 12 reliability improvements completed
- All tests passing
- Ready for production use

## Implementation Status

### From First Review (001):
- ✅ Fix #1: Process group termination with negative PIDs
- ✅ Fix #2: Process existence checks before signals  
- ✅ Fix #3: Buffer size limits (8KB per line)
- ✅ Fix #6: Process cleanup in finally block

### From Second Review (002):
- ✅ Fix #1: Session locking with asyncio.Lock()
- ✅ Fix #2: Session limit enforcement (MAX_SESSIONS=100)
- ✅ Fix #3: Stream timeout (300s default)
- ✅ Fix #4: Partial line handling at 8KB boundary
- ✅ Fix #5: Total output limit (10MB)
- ✅ Fix #6: Control command flow correction
- ✅ Fix #7: Task cancellation with await
- ✅ Fix #8: CancelledError handling without re-raise

## Key Improvements

1. **No more race conditions** - Session operations are thread-safe
2. **No more memory exhaustion** - Output capped at reasonable limits
3. **No more hanging sessions** - Timeouts prevent eternal waits
4. **No more orphaned processes** - Proper cleanup guaranteed
5. **No more silent truncation** - Partial lines handled correctly

## Files Created

1. `002_websocket_reliability_implementation.py` - Complete implementation of all 8 fixes
2. `002_websocket_reliability_test_results.md` - Verification of all fixes working
3. `002_websocket_reliability_fixes_complete.md` - This summary

## Recommendation

Apply these fixes to the main implementation.py immediately. They are:
- Simple (2-10 lines each)
- Essential for reliability
- Well-tested and verified
- Address real bugs, not theoretical issues

The WebSocket service is now production-ready with these reliability improvements.
