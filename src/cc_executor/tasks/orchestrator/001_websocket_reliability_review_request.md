# Code Review Request 001: WebSocket Reliability & Process Control

**Date**: 2025-06-25  
**Requester**: Claude Opus  
**Reviewer**: O3  
**Focus Area**: Bidirectional WebSocket reliability and subprocess lifecycle management

## Critical Areas for Review

### Core Implementation
**File**: `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/src/cc_executor/core/implementation.py`

Please focus on these high-risk areas:

1. **WebSocket Connection Reliability** (lines ~180-230)
   - How are disconnections handled?
   - What happens to running processes when WebSocket drops?
   - Is cleanup guaranteed?

2. **Process Control Edge Cases** (lines ~145-170)
   - SIGSTOP/SIGCONT race conditions
   - Process group handling with `os.setsid()`
   - Orphaned process prevention

3. **Back-Pressure Handling** (lines ~250-300)
   - Buffer overflow prevention
   - Memory management for high-output processes
   - Dropping strategy correctness

4. **Concurrent Session Management**
   - Multiple WebSocket connections
   - Session isolation
   - Resource cleanup on disconnect

## Test Scenarios to Execute

1. **Stress Test WebSocket Reliability**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start service
   cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/src/cc_executor/core
   python implementation.py --port 8003
   
   # Terminal 2: Run stress tests
   cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/src/cc_executor/tests/stress
   python unified_stress_test_executor.py --categories extreme_stress
   ```

2. **Test Process Control**:
   - Start a long-running process
   - Send PAUSE signal, verify process stops
   - Send RESUME signal, verify process continues
   - Disconnect WebSocket, verify process cleanup

3. **Test Back-Pressure**:
   - Execute: `yes | pv -qL 50000` for 60 seconds
   - Monitor memory usage (should stay < 100MB)
   - Verify buffer dropping works correctly

## Expected Deliverables

Following the naming convention in O3_REVIEW_CONTEXT.md, create:

1. **Review Feedback**: `001_websocket_reliability_review_feedback.md`
   - Focus on reliability issues found
   - Include execution logs showing any failures
   - Line-specific fixes for edge cases

2. **Fix Tasks**: `001_websocket_reliability_fixes.json`
   ```json
   {
     "review_id": "001_websocket_reliability",
     "component": "core_implementation",
     "focus": "websocket_reliability_and_process_control",
     "fixes": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "severity": "critical",
         "category": "connection_handling",
         "file": "implementation.py",
         "line": 185,
         "issue": "WebSocket disconnect doesn't kill subprocess",
         "fix": "Add finally block to ensure process termination",
         "test": "Disconnect during long-running process"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Why This Matters

The reliability of bidirectional communication is THE core feature of this MCP implementation. Without rock-solid WebSocket handling and process control, the entire system fails. Focus your review on finding edge cases where:

- Processes could be orphaned
- Memory could grow unbounded
- Connections could hang
- State could become inconsistent

These are the real bugs that will break production usage.
