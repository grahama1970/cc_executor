# Tool Sequence Optimization - Final Implementation

## What Was Built

### 1. **Enhanced mcp_arango_tools.py**
Added 3 new methods to support tool journey tracking:
- `find_tool_sequences()` - Uses BM25 search to find similar tasks and their successful tool sequences
- `analyze_tool_performance()` - Analyzes tool usage patterns and success rates
- `store_tool_journey()` - Stores completed journeys for future learning

These are exposed as MCP tools:
- `mcp__arango-tools__find_tool_sequences`
- `mcp__arango-tools__analyze_tool_performance`
- `mcp__arango-tools__store_tool_journey`

### 2. **mcp_tool_sequence_optimizer.py**
A clean MCP server that uses ONLY existing mcp_arango_tools methods:
- No duplicate database logic
- Leverages existing BM25 search capabilities
- Uses existing learning system (discover_patterns, track_solution_outcome)

Key tools:
- `optimize_tool_sequence` - Find optimal sequence for a task
- `record_sequence_step` - Track tool usage in real-time
- `complete_sequence_journey` - Complete and learn from journey
- `find_successful_sequences` - Query historical sequences
- `analyze_sequence_performance` - Performance analytics

### 3. **How It Works**

#### Task Start:
```python
# Agent has a task
result = await mcp__tool-sequence-optimizer__optimize_tool_sequence(
    task_description="Fix ModuleNotFoundError for pandas",
    error_context='{"error_type": "ModuleNotFoundError", "module": "pandas"}'
)
# Returns: {
#   "journey_id": "journey_abc123",
#   "recommended_sequence": ["assess_complexity", "discover_patterns", "track_solution_outcome"],
#   "confidence": 0.85
# }
```

#### During Execution:
```python
# As agent uses each tool
await mcp__tool-sequence-optimizer__record_sequence_step(
    journey_id="journey_abc123",
    tool_name="assess_complexity",
    success=True,
    duration_ms=523
)
```

#### Task Completion:
```python
# When done
await mcp__tool-sequence-optimizer__complete_sequence_journey(
    journey_id="journey_abc123",
    outcome="success",
    solution_description="Added pandas to requirements.txt",
    category="module_import"
)
```

This automatically:
1. Calls `mcp__arango-tools__track_solution_outcome` to record the fix
2. Calls `mcp__arango-tools__extract_lesson` if successful
3. Calls `mcp__arango-tools__store_tool_journey` to save for future optimization

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. **No Duplicate Logic**
- All database operations in mcp_arango_tools.py
- Sequence optimizer is just orchestration
- Clean separation of concerns

### 2. **Uses Existing Infrastructure**
- BM25 search via `advanced_search()` and `execute_aql()`
- Learning system via `track_solution_outcome()` and `extract_lesson()`
- Pattern discovery via `discover_patterns()`

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**
- Works with basic pattern matching initially
- Gets smarter as data accumulates
- Leverages ArangoDB's graph capabilities

## Data Flow

```
1. Task arrives → optimize_tool_sequence()
   ↓
2. Searches for similar tasks using:
   - mcp__arango-tools__advanced_search (BM25)
   - mcp__arango-tools__execute_aql (graph queries)
   ↓
3. Returns optimal sequence based on:
   - Historical success rates
   - Similar task patterns
   - Graph relationships
   ↓
4. Agent follows sequence, recording each step
   ↓
5. On completion:
   - mcp__arango-tools__store_tool_journey
   - mcp__arango-tools__track_solution_outcome
   - mcp__arango-tools__extract_lesson
```

## Example Usage

### Finding Optimal Sequence:
```python
# Agent needs to fix an error
result = await mcp__tool-sequence-optimizer__optimize_tool_sequence(
    task_description="Debug AsyncIO subprocess deadlock when buffer fills",
    error_context='{"error_type": "TimeoutError", "context": "subprocess"}'
)

# Get back:
{
  "journey_id": "journey_xyz789",
  "recommended_sequence": [
    "assess_complexity",      # Understand the issue
    "perplexity_ask",        # Research best practices
    "send_to_gemini",        # Get code fix
    "track_solution_outcome" # Record success
  ],
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "reasoning": "Based on BM25 search and pattern analysis for 'asyncio subprocess'"
}
```

### Learning from Success:
```python
# After successful resolution
await mcp__tool-sequence-optimizer__complete_sequence_journey(
    journey_id="journey_xyz789",
    outcome="success",
    solution_description="Added stream draining to prevent buffer overflow",
    category="async_subprocess"
)

# This creates:
# 1. Journey record with tool sequence
# 2. Solution outcome tracking
# 3. Extracted lesson for future use
```

## Configuration

All MCP servers are configured in `.mcp.json`:
- `arango-tools` - Enhanced with journey methods
- `tool-sequence-optimizer` - Clean orchestration layer
- `logger-tools` - For error assessment
- `d3-visualizer` - For visualizing tool sequences

## Next Steps

1. **Start Using It**
   - Every task should call `optimize_tool_sequence` first
   - Record all tool usage
   - Complete journeys with outcomes

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Use `analyze_sequence_performance` regularly
   - Watch success rates improve
   - Identify bottleneck tools

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add BERT embeddings for better similarity
   - Implement multi-hop graph traversal
   - Create real-time sequence adaptation

The system is designed to start simple and improve with every use!
