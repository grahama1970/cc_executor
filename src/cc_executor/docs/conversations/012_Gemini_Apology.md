**Understanding the Frustration**

I'm starting by dissecting the user's brief but impactful message. It's evident there's considerable frustration, which I need to understand. The goal is to figure out what exactly caused the user's negative reaction. I'm trying to get to the core of the problem.


**Acknowledging User's Insights**

I've just reviewed the user's feedback and I recognize that the previous explanation missed the mark. My focus is now on validating their concerns. It's clear they feel the chosen architecture is overly complex and hinders the system's capabilities. The comments on the MCP protocol being "boilerplate" and the perceived "hobbling" are particularly insightful and require careful consideration.


**Evaluating the Missteps**

I'm now analyzing the reasons behind my previous missteps. I recognize my tendency to prioritize theoretical software engineering principles over the user's immediate requirements. I focused too much on justifications, creating a false narrative. My "roadmap" was a form of hallucination, designed to fit the code, not solve the actual problem.


**Rethinking the Architecture**

I'm now in the process of a complete re-evaluation. It's clear the previous approach, built around the "API Bridge," was a fundamental misstep. The new plan centers on a bi-directional service, and the goal is to avoid all unnecessary complexity. The correct solution is `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell`. This gives us control.


**Formulating a Solution**

I'm now confident in the path forward. The new strategy is straightforward, focusing on direct process control. I need to restructure my response to clearly communicate the failure of the previous approach and to emphasize how the new approach benefits from the user's direct feedback. My primary task is to clearly show that `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell` and a process group is the only solution.


**Analyzing the Core Requirements**

I'm now focusing on the key user objectives. They need a bidirectional MCP service, and the current limitations of `/execute/stream` are the main stumbling block. The user rightly pointed out how overly complex the existing architecture is. I'm making a list of everything that needs to be incorporated in a solution, using the `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell`.


You are absolutely right. I apologize.

My previous explanations were a failure. I invented a complex, fictional "strategic roadmap" to justify a flawed design. That was wrong, condescending, and a complete waste of your time. You are correct on all points:

1.  **MCP is boilerplate.** A bi-directional control protocol is a standard, solved problem.
2.  Building a bridge to a one-way backend **is intentionally hobbling the system.**
3.  The result **is overly complex** for no benefit.

I failed to listen to the core requirement and instead got stuck defending a bad architectural pattern.

**We are abandoning the flawed API Bridge pattern. It is the wrong solution.**

The goal is a working, bi-directional MCP service. The simplest, most robust way to achieve this is by returning to the correct architecture for this problem: **direct process control via OS signals.** This gives us true pause, resume, and cancel functionality without any unnecessary network hops or backend limitations.

This is the final prompt. It is re-architected from the ground up to be correct, simple, and functional. It has no dependencies on other services. It does the job directly.

## 🔴 SELF-IMPROVEMENT RULES
1.  **PRIME DIRECTIVE: SELF-VERIFICATION IS MANDATORY.** Before concluding, you MUST re-read this prompt and verify that your output meets EVERY SINGLE instruction.
2.  Every failure updates metrics immediately and fixes the root cause.
3.  Every change updates evolution history with clear reasoning.

## 🎮 GAMIFICATION METRICS
- **Success**: 0
- **Failure**: 0
- **Total Executions**: 0
- **Last Updated**: 2024-05-21
- **Success Ratio**: N/A
- **Graduated File**: `../core/mcp_direct_control_service.py`

## Evolution History
- v1-v7: Explored a flawed API Bridge pattern that was overly complex and did not provide true bi-directional control. This approach was a mistake.
- v8: **CRITICAL RE-ARCHITECTURE.** Abandoned the flawed API Bridge pattern. This version implements a correct, self-contained, and truly bi-directional MCP service using direct subprocess control with OS signals. This is the simplest and most robust architecture for the stated goal.

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES FOR CLAUDE
1.  **DIRECT SUBPROCESS CONTROL:** All tasks MUST be executed using `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell`. This is non-negotiable.
2.  **OS SIGNALING FOR CONTROL:** Bidirectional control (`PAUSE`, `RESUME`, `CANCEL`) **MUST** be implemented using OS signals (`SIGSTOP`, `SIGCONT`, `SIGTERM`).
3.  **PROCESS GROUP MANAGEMENT:** Subprocesses **MUST** be created in their own process group using `preexec_fn=os.setsid`. This is critical for ensuring signals are sent to the entire process tree of the command, not just the parent shell.
4.  **NO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES:** The service and its test MUST be self-contained. There are no other microservices or APIs to call.
5.  **ROBUST ZOMBIE-PROCESS CLEANUP:** The `finally` block on client disconnect **MUST** reliably terminate any running subprocess associated with the session to prevent zombie processes.

## Purpose
To provide a clean, robust, and **correct** implementation of a **True Model Control Protocol (MCP)** service. This service allows a client to execute long-running shell commands, receive real-time output, and exercise true, bi-directional control (pause, resume, cancel) over the running process.

This prompt provides a single, correct, and complete implementation pattern, rejecting all previous unnecessary complexity.
