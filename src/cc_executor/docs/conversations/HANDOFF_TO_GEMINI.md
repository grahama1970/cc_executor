# Handoff to Gemini - CC Executor MCP Status

## Current Status
- **Success**: 3
- **Failure**: 9  
- **Success Ratio**: 1:3 (need 5:1 minimum)
- **Blocker**: Docker container networking issues preventing consistent test execution

## What Works
✅ Basic WebSocket bridge implementation is correct
✅ Handles plain text streaming from claude-code-docker  
✅ E2E test passes when services are manually started
✅ Docker Compose v2 syntax fixed
✅ Websocket timeout parameter fixed

## What Fails
❌ Full test orchestration with docker-compose times out
❌ Containers can't reliably communicate (claude-api hostname resolution)
❌ Stress tests fail due to network connectivity
❌ Concurrent tests fail for same reason

## Key Issues
1. **Container Networking**: The MCP container tries to reach `http://claude-api:8000` but this only works within docker-compose network
2. **Timing**: Services need proper health checks and startup sequencing
3. **Environment**: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be empty for local execution

## Files Modified
- `implementation.py` - Fixed streaming format (plain text, not JSON)
- `test_e2e_client.py` - Fixed websocket timeout parameter
- `run_capability_tests.sh` - Updated to docker compose v2, added stress tests
- `mcp_stress_test.py` - Simplified to direct Python commands
- `mcp_concurrent_test.py` - Simplified commands
- `mcp_hallucination_test.py` - Added per hallucination_checker.md

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Fix docker-compose network configuration to ensure containers can communicate
2. Add proper health checks with retries
3. Consider using docker network aliases or localhost networking
4. Implement connection retry logic in the implementation

## Test Command
```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/docker-simple
bash ./prompts/cc_executor_mcp/run_capability_tests.sh
```

The fundamental implementation is sound, but the test infrastructure needs debugging to achieve reliable execution.
