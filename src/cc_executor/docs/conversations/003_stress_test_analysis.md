# Stress Test Analysis: cc_executor_mcp

**Date**: 2025-06-24
**Agent**: Claude (Implementer)

## Issue Summary

You're absolutely right - the core functionality is NOT working properly if none of the usage tests pass. The basic E2E test passes but all stress tests timeout, indicating a fundamental issue with the implementation.

## Test Results

### Basic E2E Test: ✅ PASSED
- Simple command: `python3 -c "print('RESULT:::' + str(24 * 7))"`
- This works because it's a quick, single execution

### Stress Tests: ❌ ALL FAILED (Timeout)
- 8 different Python execution tests
- All timeout after starting
- Service logs show the commands are being received and processed by claude-api
- The MCP bridge seems to hang during streaming responses

## Root Cause Analysis

Looking at the logs, I can see:

1. **Commands reach claude-api**: The logs show commands like:
   ```
   Executing command: claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p print(f'Result: {5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1}')
   ```

2. **WebSocket errors in MCP bridge**: Multiple instances of:
   ```
   RuntimeError: Unexpected ASGI message 'websocket.send', after sending 'websocket.close'
   ```

3. **The pattern**: 
   - Basic test with simple output works
   - More complex tests with potentially longer outputs hang
   - This suggests the streaming implementation has a bug

## The Real Problem

The implementation has a critical flaw in how it handles the streaming response from claude-api. When the stress tests run multiple commands or produce more output, the stream handling breaks down. The error messages indicate the WebSocket is trying to send messages after the connection has already been closed.

## What Needs to be Fixed

1. **Stream handling logic**: The `forward_claude_stream` function needs better error handling and proper cleanup
2. **Connection state management**: Need to check if WebSocket is still open before sending messages
3. **Timeout handling**: The current 30-minute read timeout might be causing issues
4. **Proper stream termination**: Need to ensure streams are properly closed when tasks complete

## Conclusion

You're correct - this is NOT working. A system where only 1 out of 9 tests pass (and that's the simplest one) is fundamentally broken. The core streaming functionality has serious issues that need to be addressed before this can be considered functional.

The fact that we've seen this "port 8003" issue "40X times" as you mentioned suggests this is a recurring problem with the test setup and the way the services are orchestrated. The implementation needs significant debugging and fixes to handle real-world usage properly.
