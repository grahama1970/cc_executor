# Reliability Assessment for cc_executor_mcp

## Current State vs. Reliability Requirements

### ‚úÖ What's Already Implemented:

1. **Subprocess Cleanup**:
   - Process group management with `os.setsid`
   - Cleanup in finally block on disconnect
   - SIGTERM to process group on session end

2. **Basic State Management**:
   - Session tracking with unique IDs
   - Process state (RUNNING, PAUSED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
   - Status updates via JSON-RPC

3. **Structured Logging**:
   - All operations logged with context
   - Request tracking for debugging

### ‚ùå Critical Reliability Gaps:

1. **No Reconnection Support**:
   - WebSocket disconnection = session lost
   - No way to resume/reconnect to running process
   - No session persistence

2. **No Backpressure Handling (T02 not done)**:
   - Unlimited buffering of stdout/stderr
   - Can cause memory exhaustion with verbose processes
   - No flow control or throttling

3. **No Heartbeat/Keep-Alive**:
   - Can't detect stale connections quickly
   - No ping/pong mechanism
   - Dead connections may linger

4. **No Output Buffering Limits**:
   - Streams read line-by-line but no limits
   - High-output processes can overwhelm
   - No dropping or prioritization strategy

5. **No Stress Testing (T03 not done)**:
   - Haven't tested concurrent sessions
   - Unknown behavior under load
   - No performance metrics

### üîß What Needs to be Done for Reliability:

1. **Implement T02 - Back-Pressure Handling** (CRITICAL):
   ```python
   # Add configurable limits
   MAX_OUTPUT_BUFFER_SIZE = int(os.environ.get('MAX_OUTPUT_BUFFER', '1048576'))  # 1MB
   OUTPUT_LINE_LIMIT = int(os.environ.get('OUTPUT_LINE_LIMIT', '1000'))
   
   # Implement circular buffer or dropping strategy
   class BoundedOutputBuffer:
       def __init__(self, max_size, max_lines):
           self.buffer = collections.deque(maxlen=max_lines)
           self.total_size = 0
           self.dropped_lines = 0
   ```

2. **Add Heartbeat Mechanism**:
   ```python
   async def heartbeat_task(websocket, interval=30):
       while True:
           await asyncio.sleep(interval)
           try:
               await websocket.ping()
           except:
               break  # Connection dead
   ```

3. **Session Persistence**:
   - Store session state that survives reconnection
   - Allow clients to resume by session ID
   - Track last sent output position

4. **Implement T03 - Stress Tests**:
   - Test with high-output processes
   - Concurrent session limits
   - Memory usage under load

5. **Add Connection State Machine**:
   - CONNECTING ‚Üí CONNECTED ‚Üí DISCONNECTED ‚Üí RECONNECTING
   - Graceful handling of each transition

## Priority for Long-Running Claude Code Instances:

1. **HIGHEST**: T02 (Back-pressure) - Prevents memory exhaustion
2. **HIGH**: Heartbeat/keep-alive - Detects dead connections
3. **HIGH**: T03 (Stress tests) - Validates reliability
4. **MEDIUM**: Session persistence - Nice for development
5. **LOW**: Security (as you noted)

## Recommendation:

The current implementation will work for simple cases but will fail with:
- Verbose/high-output processes (no backpressure)
- Long-running processes with network interruptions (no reconnect)
- Multiple concurrent sessions under load (untested)

**Next Step**: Implement T02 (Back-Pressure Handling) immediately to prevent the most common failure mode.
