# Security Review Findings for cc_executor_mcp

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Done Well:
1. **Command Allow-List**: Properly validates base commands against whitelist
2. **No Shell Execution**: Uses `/bin/bash -c` but with `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` (not shell=True)
3. **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with request IDs and security context
4. **Process Group Control**: Uses `os.setsid` for proper signal management
5. **JSON-RPC Error Format**: Proper error codes (-32602) for security denials
6. **Audit Logging**: Logs all execution attempts (allowed and denied)

### ‚ùå Critical Security Issues Found:

1. **No Authentication/Authorization**
   - WebSocket accepts ANY connection without authentication
   - No user/session validation
   - CORS allows all origins (*)

2. **Command Injection Risk**
   - While we validate base command, we still pass full string to bash -c
   - Example: `echo hello; rm -rf /` would pass if 'echo' is allowed
   - Should parse and validate ALL parts, not just first command

3. **No Rate Limiting**
   - No protection against DoS attacks
   - Clients can spawn unlimited processes
   - No concurrent session limits

4. **Missing Resource Limits**
   - No memory/CPU limits on spawned processes
   - No output size limits (buffer bloat risk)
   - No timeout on long-running processes

5. **Insufficient Process Validation**
   - Anyone can send PAUSE/RESUME/CANCEL to any session's process
   - No verification of process ownership beyond session

6. **Plaintext WebSocket (ws://)**
   - Not using WSS for encryption
   - Vulnerable to MITM attacks

### üîß Recommendations for Production:

1. **Immediate Fixes**:
   ```python
   # Fix command injection by NOT using shell
   proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
       base_command, *args,  # Direct execution, no shell
       stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
       stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
       preexec_fn=os.setsid
   )
   ```

2. **Add Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT or API key validation
   - Verify on connection AND per-message

3. **Add Rate Limiting**:
   - Max commands per session per minute
   - Max concurrent sessions per client
   - Max output bytes per command

4. **Resource Controls**:
   - Set ulimits on child processes
   - Implement execution timeouts
   - Cap output buffer sizes

5. **Use WSS**:
   - Configure TLS certificates
   - Enforce encrypted connections only

## Code Quality Issues:

1. **Error Handling**: Some async errors can leak (see asyncio task exceptions)
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: No cleanup on server shutdown
3. **Memory Leaks**: Sessions may not be cleaned up on abnormal disconnects
4. **Type Hints**: Missing in some places (Any types used)

## Summary:

The implementation has good foundations (logging, allow-lists, process control) but is **NOT production-ready** due to:
- No authentication
- Command injection vulnerabilities  
- No rate limiting or resource controls
- Using plaintext WebSocket

These MUST be fixed before any production deployment.
