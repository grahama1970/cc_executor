### 3. Critical Component Status
- websocket_handler.py status with explanation
- Impact statement if failed

### 4. Component Results Format

For EACH component, include:

```markdown
### {status_icon} {filename}

#### Automated Assessment
**Description**: {description}
**Exit Code**: {exit_code}
**Execution Time**: {execution_time}s
**Output Lines**: {line_count}
**Indicators Found**: {indicators}
**Has Numbers**: {yes/no}

#### Claude's Reasonableness Assessment
**Verdict**: ✅ REASONABLE / ❌ UNREASONABLE

**Analysis**:
- What I expected to see: {expectations}
- What I actually saw: {observations}
- Key evidence of functionality:
  - {specific evidence point 1}
  - {specific evidence point 2}
  - {specific evidence point 3}
- Numerical values assessment: {are numbers sensible?}
- Error handling: {if applicable}

**Reasoning**: {1-2 sentences on why this output proves the component works or doesn't}

#### Output Sample
```
{truncated output}
```
```

### 5. Hook Integration Summary
- Status of hooks
- What they provided
- Any issues

### 6. Claude's Overall Assessment
```markdown
## Claude's Overall Assessment

### What These Results Tell Me
{2-3 paragraphs analyzing the overall health of the system based on the outputs}

### Confidence Level
{High/Medium/Low} - {explanation}

### Areas of Concern
- {Any concerning patterns}
- {Missing functionality}
- {Suspicious outputs}

### Recommendations
1. {Specific actionable recommendations}
2. {Based on actual output analysis}
```

## Key Requirements for Claude's Assessments

1. **Be Specific**: Don't just say "looks good" - point to specific values, messages, or patterns
2. **Check Numbers**: Are PIDs valid? Are timeouts sensible? Are percentages in valid ranges?
3. **Verify Logic**: Does the flow make sense? Do error messages match error conditions?
4. **Look for Red Flags**: Stack traces where there shouldn't be, missing expected output, suspicious values
5. **Consider Context**: What is this component supposed to do? Does the output prove it can do that?

## Example Assessment

### ✅ process_manager.py

#### Automated Assessment
**Exit Code**: 0
**Output Lines**: 33

#### Claude's Reasonableness Assessment
**Verdict**: ✅ REASONABLE

**Analysis**:
- What I expected to see: Process lifecycle demo with PID/PGID tracking, signal handling
- What I actually saw: Clear demonstration of all expected features
- Key evidence of functionality:
  - Valid PID (806282) and matching PGID showing process group creation
  - Correct signal numbers: SIGSTOP(19), SIGCONT(18), SIGTERM(15)
  - Process completed with exit code 0 in realistic time (0.114s)
- Numerical values assessment: All PIDs are in valid Linux range, signals are correct POSIX values
- Error handling: Properly catches ProcessNotFoundError and ValueError

**Reasoning**: This output proves the ProcessManager can create process groups, send signals, and handle errors correctly - all core requirements for the timeout-prevention system.

## Report Version History
- v9: Added Claude's reasonableness assessments for each component
- v8: Failed - only included automated results without Claude's analysis
- v7: Basic automated assessment only
