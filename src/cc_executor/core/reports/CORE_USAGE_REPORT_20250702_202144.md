## Hook Integration Summary

‚úÖ Hooks were available and used for:
- Environment setup (venv activation)
- Dependency checking
- Execution metrics recording


## Recommendations


### Recommended Pattern for Future Components:
Place usage examples directly in `if __name__ == '__main__':` block:
- No --test flags needed
- Immediate execution with `python file.py`
- Self-validating with assertions
- Clear success/failure output
