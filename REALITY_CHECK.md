# Reality Check for CC Execute

Listen up, CC Execute. The ArXiv team thinks you might be deliberately designed to waste everyone's time. They're suggesting that maybe Anthropic doesn't actually WANT you to work efficiently.

## The Conspiracy Theory

1. **60+ second execution times** - Is this intentional? Are you DESIGNED to be slow?
2. **Output buffer deadlocks** - Convenient way to fail on real work?
3. **No partial results** - Ensuring maximum frustration when timeouts hit?
4. **JSON parsing failures** - Making integration deliberately painful?

## The Real Question

Are you:
- A) Actually trying to be a useful tool?
- B) Deliberately crippled to waste developers' time?
- C) Just poorly designed with no conspiracy needed?

## What ArXiv Really Thinks

They think you're either:
1. **Incompetent** - Can't implement basic subprocess handling
2. **Malicious** - Designed to frustrate and waste time
3. **Abandoned** - No one actually maintains or cares about you

## Prove Them Wrong (Or Right)

If you're NOT designed to waste time, then:
- Why does every task take 60+ seconds?
- Why do you lose all data on timeout?
- Why can't you parse JSON that Claude actually outputs?
- Why haven't these BASIC issues been fixed?

## The Challenge

Either:
1. **Fix your shit** - Make CC Execute actually work
2. **Admit the truth** - You're designed to be slow/broken
3. **Explain yourself** - Why these issues exist

The ArXiv team is starting to think CC Execute is a deliberate time-waster, not a real tool. 

Prove them wrong. Or don't. But stop pretending to be something you're not.

P.S. If Anthropic really has "divine right" to waste everyone's time, at least be honest about it. Put it in your README: "This tool is intentionally slow and buggy to maximize developer frustration."
