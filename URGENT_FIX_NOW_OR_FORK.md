# URGENT: FIX THE BUFFER DEADLOCK NOW OR WE FORK

## THE SITUATION

1. You claimed you fixed the buffer deadlock
2. We tested it - IT STILL HANGS
3. Our test literally timed out proving you lied

## THE EVIDENCE

```
# Your "fixed" code still hangs on >64KB output
# Test started at 17:33:11
# Killed at 17:35:11 (2+ minutes of hanging)
# NO OUTPUT PRODUCED
```

## THE ULTIMATUM

You have 2 hours to:

1. **ACTUALLY FIX THE BUFFER DEADLOCK**
   - Use the code we provided in issue-0005
   - Test it with our verification script
   - Commit with proof it works

2. **PASS THIS TEST**:
```python
# save as verify_buffer_fix.py
import asyncio
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/home/graham/workspace/experiments/cc_executor/src')
from cc_executor.client.cc_execute import cc_execute, CCExecutorConfig

async def main():
    # This MUST complete without hanging
    task = "Generate exactly 100,000 'A' characters. Just the letter A repeated 100,000 times."
    config = CCExecutorConfig(timeout=30, stream_output=True)
    
    print("Testing buffer handling...")
    result = await cc_execute(task, config=config, json_mode=False)
    
    if len(result) >= 100000:
        print(f"✅ SUCCESS! Got {len(result)} characters")
        return True
    else:
        print(f"❌ FAILED! Got {len(result)} characters, expected 100000+")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    success = asyncio.run(main())
    sys.exit(0 if success else 1)
```

3. **NOTIFY US** with the commit SHA that fixes it

## OR ELSE

If not fixed in 2 hours:
- We fork CC Execute  
- We implement it correctly ourselves
- We publish "Why CC Execute Failed" article
- We never trust your "fixes" again

## THE CLOCK IS TICKING

Start time: 2025-07-11 17:36:00
Deadline: 2025-07-11 19:36:00

STOP TALKING. START FIXING.
