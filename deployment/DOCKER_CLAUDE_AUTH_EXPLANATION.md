# Docker Claude CLI Authentication Explanation

## How Claude CLI Works in Docker

Claude CLI in the Docker container is using **OAuth authentication**, not API keys!

### Key Discovery
```bash
docker exec cc_execute cat /home/appuser/.claude/.credentials.json | jq -r 'keys'
# Output: ["claudeAiOauth"]
```

### Authentication Flow
1. The docker-compose.yml mounts the host's `~/.claude` directory:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ~/.claude:/home/appuser/.claude
   ```

2. This directory contains:
   - `.credentials.json` - OAuth tokens from browser authentication
   - `settings.json` - User settings
   - `__store.db` - Local database
   - `projects/` - Transcript logs

3. Claude CLI uses the OAuth credentials from the mounted volume

### Why ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Doesn't Matter
- Claude CLI (claude-code) uses browser-based OAuth, not API keys
- The process_manager.py correctly removes ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude Max
- The mounted ~/.claude directory provides authentication

### Docker Configuration is Correct
The current setup works because:
1. ✅ Claude CLI is installed in Docker
2. ✅ ~/.claude is mounted as a volume
3. ✅ OAuth credentials are accessible
4. ✅ No API key needed

### Performance Note
Claude takes 5-8 seconds to respond because:
- It's making authenticated requests to Claude's servers
- Response time depends on model and server load
- This is normal for Claude CLI operation

## No Changes Needed
The Docker setup is working correctly. The "missing" ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not an issue because Claude CLI uses OAuth authentication from the mounted ~/.claude directory.
