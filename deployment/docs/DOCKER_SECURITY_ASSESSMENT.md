# Docker Security Assessment - CC Executor

## Overview

This document assesses the security architecture of CC Executor's Docker deployment for running Claude Code in a contained environment.

## Current Architecture

### Container Structure
- **cc_execute container**: Runs both FastAPI and WebSocket services
- **redis container**: Session management
- **Shared volumes**: 
  - `~/.claude:/home/appuser/.claude:ro` (read-only credentials)
  - `./logs:/app/logs` (logging)
  - `./data:/app/data` (data storage)

### Security Considerations

#### 1. **Code Execution Isolation**
**Current State**: ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- Code runs in the same container as the API/WebSocket services
- No additional sandboxing beyond Docker container isolation
- Process runs as `appuser` (non-root) ✅

**Recommendations**:
- Consider separate execution container with more restricted capabilities
- Use Docker security options: `--cap-drop ALL`, `--security-opt no-new-privileges`
- Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, disk I/O)

#### 2. **Network Security**
**Current State**: ✅ GOOD
- Services communicate within Docker network
- Only necessary ports exposed to host
- Redis not exposed externally

**Improvements**:
- Add network policies to restrict inter-container communication
- Use TLS for WebSocket connections in production

#### 3. **File System Security**
**Current State**: ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- Claude credentials mounted read-only ✅
- Logs and data directories are writable
- No restrictions on file creation within container

**Recommendations**:
- Use temporary filesystems for execution
- Implement quota limits
- Mount execution workspace as tmpfs with size limits

#### 4. **Process Management**
**Current State**: ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- Processes created with `os.setsid` for group management ✅
- No cgroup limits on spawned processes
- No restrictions on process creation

**Recommendations**:
- Set `--pids-limit` to prevent fork bombs
- Use cgroup limits for CPU and memory per process
- Implement process monitoring and automatic cleanup

## Proposed Enhanced Architecture

### 1. **Separate Execution Container**
```yaml
services:
  cc_executor:
    # Main service container (API + WebSocket)
    # ... existing config ...
    
  cc_worker:
    # Isolated execution container
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: deployment/Dockerfile.worker
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges
      - seccomp:unconfined  # May need for some operations
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - SETUID  # For user switching if needed
      - SETGID
    pids_limit: 100
    mem_limit: 2g
    cpus: 1
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:size=100M
      - /workspace:size=500M
    read_only: true  # Read-only root filesystem
    volumes:
      - type: tmpfs
        target: /home/worker
        tmpfs:
          size: 100M
```

### 2. **Execution Flow**
1. API receives execution request
2. Creates job in Redis queue
3. Worker container picks up job
4. Executes in isolated environment
5. Returns results via Redis
6. API streams results to client

### 3. **Security Layers**
1. **Container isolation**: Separate containers for API and execution
2. **User isolation**: Different users in different containers
3. **Resource limits**: CPU, memory, PID, disk quotas
4. **Network isolation**: Execution container has no external network access
5. **Filesystem isolation**: Read-only root, tmpfs for workspace

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Isolation
1. Add resource limits to current container
2. Implement tmpfs for execution workspace
3. Add security options to docker-compose

### Phase 2: Worker Container
1. Create separate worker container
2. Implement job queue system
3. Move execution to worker container

### Phase 3: Enhanced Security
1. Implement seccomp profiles
2. Add AppArmor/SELinux policies
3. Implement audit logging

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. Never mount sensitive directories into the container
2. Use read-only mounts where possible
3. Regularly update base images
4. Monitor container logs for suspicious activity

### For Operators
1. Run containers with minimal privileges
2. Use container scanning tools
3. Implement log aggregation and monitoring
4. Regular security audits

## Conclusion

While the current Docker deployment provides basic isolation, significant improvements are needed for production use where untrusted code execution is expected. The proposed architecture provides defense-in-depth with multiple layers of security.

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 1 security improvements immediately
2. Design and test worker container architecture
3. Create security test suite
4. Document security model for users
