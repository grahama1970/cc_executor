## Summary

This is a comprehensive review request for the CC Executor project before deployment. The project provides a Python API and MCP server for executing Claude CLI commands with structured output, timeout management, and hook integration. All major refactoring has been completed including the migration from `return_json` to `json_mode` parameter naming.

**CRITICAL: Multi-Task Sequential Execution Status**
- [x] Changes maintain WebSocket blocking for sequential execution
- [x] No parallel execution introduced
- [x] Orchestrator pattern preserved

## Changes Made

### Files Modified/Created
- `src/cc_executor/client/cc_execute.py` - Main Python API with json_mode parameter
- `src/cc_executor/core/websocket_handler.py` - WebSocket server with hook integration
- `src/cc_executor/core/process_manager.py` - Process execution with async-safe hooks
- `src/cc_executor/hooks/hook_integration.py` - Async/sync hook implementation
- `src/cc_executor/utils/json_utils.py` - Robust JSON parsing utilities
- `tests/integration/test_simple_prompt_with_mcp.py` - MCP integration test

### Key Changes

1. **API Standardization**:
   - Migrated from `return_json` to `json_mode` (industry standard)
   - Added backward compatibility with deprecation warnings
   - Automatic use of `clean_json_string` when `json_mode=True`

2. **Hook Integration Fixes**:
   - Created separate sync/async versions to prevent event loop blocking
   - Re-enabled hooks in process_manager.py
   - Fixed all `subprocess.run()` usage in async contexts

3. **Project Cleanup**:
   - Archived 43 unreferenced Python files
   - Removed duplicate implementations
   - Organized test structure
   - Documentation deduplicated

## Testing Performed

### Automated Tests
- [x] All `if __name__ == "__main__"` blocks execute successfully
- [x] Results saved to `tmp/responses/` and verified
- [x] Assertions pass for expected behavior
- [x] Exit codes correct (0 for success, 1 for failure)
- [x] No circular imports or recursive loops
- [x] Hook system doesn't cause server crashes

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test basic execution with Python API
cd tests/integration
python test_simple_prompt_with_mcp.py
# Output: Successfully created add_numbers.py with JSON response

# Test MCP server
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/health
# Output: {"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0"}

# Test with json_mode
from cc_executor.client.cc_execute import cc_execute
result = cc_execute("Write a function to add two numbers", json_mode=True)
# Output: {'result': 'def add_numbers...', 'files_created': [...], 'execution_uuid': '...'}
```

### Test Results Summary
- **Success Rate**: Integration test passed, created working Python function
- **Performance**: Average execution time ~28 seconds for simple prompts
- **Edge Cases**: Handles markdown-wrapped JSON, malformed JSON via clean_json_string

## Code Quality Checklist

### Structure
- [x] Functions outside `__main__` block
- [x] Single `asyncio.run()` call where applicable
- [x] Proper import organization
- [x] Type hints on all main functions

### Documentation
- [x] Clear docstrings with purpose
- [x] Real-world examples in test files
- [x] README.md and QUICK_START_GUIDE.md updated
- [x] API documentation in client/README.md

### Error Handling
- [x] Try/except blocks with logging
- [x] Graceful Redis degradation
- [x] Meaningful error messages
- [x] Proper exit codes

### Best Practices
- [x] Loguru for all logging (no print statements in core code)
- [x] Redis for caching with availability check
- [x] JSON output prettified with indent=2
- [x] Results saved with timestamps in tmp/responses/
- [x] Thread-safe hook initialization
- [x] Subprocess streams properly drained (prevent deadlock)

## Potential Issues to Review

### 1. WebSocket Message Size Limit
**File**: `src/cc_executor/core/websocket_handler.py`
**Line**: N/A (not implemented)
**Description**: No explicit limit on WebSocket message size
**Risk Level**: Low
**Suggested Fix**: Add configurable max message size (default 10MB for large outputs)

### 2. Redis Connection Pool Configuration
**File**: `src/cc_executor/core/session_manager.py`
**Line**: 75-90
**Description**: Using default Redis pool settings
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Suggested Fix**: Make pool size configurable for high-concurrency scenarios

### 3. Timeout Estimation Accuracy
**File**: `src/cc_executor/client/cc_execute.py`
**Line**: 62-120
**Description**: Timeout estimation based on limited task patterns
**Risk Level**: Low
**Suggested Fix**: Collect more usage data to improve estimates

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Stable, uses streaming for large outputs
- **Execution Time**: 20-60s typical for Claude CLI commands
- **Scalability**: Single WebSocket server, suitable for developer use
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper process group termination implemented

## Security Considerations

- [x] No hardcoded credentials
- [x] Input validation for prompts (via prompt amendment)
- [x] No command injection (using subprocess lists, not shell=True)
- [x] Safe file path handling in response storage

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- `websockets>=12.0` - WebSocket server
- `loguru>=0.7.0` - Logging
- `redis>=5.0.0` - Session/cache storage
- `json-repair>=0.1.0` - Robust JSON parsing

### No New Dependencies
All dependencies are already in pyproject.toml

## Backwards Compatibility

- [x] Changes are backwards compatible
- [x] Migration from `return_json` to `json_mode` with deprecation warning
- [x] Existing WebSocket clients continue to work

## Questions for Reviewer

1. Should we implement connection pooling for multiple concurrent cc_execute calls?
2. Is the current timeout estimation logic sufficient for production use?
3. Should the MCP server support batch execution of multiple prompts?
4. Do the usage examples in tests provide clear enough guidance for developers?

## Review Focus Areas

Please pay special attention to:

1. **Developer Experience** - Are the usage examples in `tests/integration/` clear and helpful?
2. **Error Messages** - Do failures provide actionable information for debugging?
3. **JSON Parsing Robustness** - Does `clean_json_string` handle all LLM output edge cases?
4. **Hook System Reliability** - Are async/sync hooks properly isolated from the main execution?
5. **API Design** - Is the `cc_execute()` function signature intuitive for new users?

## Definition of Done

- [x] All tests pass (unit and integration)
- [x] Documentation updated (README, QUICK_START_GUIDE)
- [x] No linting errors in core modules
- [x] Performance acceptable for developer use
- [x] Security concerns addressed

## Project Context

### What is CC Executor?
CC Executor bridges Python applications with Claude's CLI, providing:
- Structured JSON responses from natural language prompts
- Automatic timeout management based on task complexity
- WebSocket-based architecture for real-time streaming
- Hook system for pre/post execution customization
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for tool integration

### Target Users
- Developers who want to integrate Claude into Python applications
- Teams needing structured AI responses (JSON mode)
- Applications requiring reliable timeout handling for AI tasks

### Deployment Readiness Checklist
- [x] Core functionality working (cc_execute with json_mode)
- [x] Tests passing and documented
- [x] Clean project structure (post-cleanup)
- [ ] Usage examples validated by external developer
- [ ] Performance metrics collected from real usage
- [ ] Deployment guide tested end-to-end

### Example Usage for Developers

```python
from cc_executor.client.cc_execute import cc_execute

# Simple usage - returns string
response = cc_execute("Write a hello world function in Python")

# JSON mode - returns structured dict
result = cc_execute(
    "Create a Python function to calculate fibonacci",
    json_mode=True
)
# Returns: {
#   "result": "def fibonacci(n):...",
#   "files_created": ["fibonacci.py"],
#   "summary": "Created fibonacci function with memoization",
#   "execution_uuid": "..."
# }

# With custom timeout
result = cc_execute(
    "Analyze this large codebase and refactor it",
    timeout=300,  # 5 minutes
    json_mode=True
)

# With session tracking
result = cc_execute(
    "Continue the previous analysis",
    session_id="my-analysis-session",
    json_mode=True
)
```

Please review with deployment readiness in mind, focusing on reliability, developer experience, and clear documentation.
