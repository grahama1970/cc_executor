# Claude Code SDK Assessment for cc_executor

## Executive Summary

The Claude Code SDK is **not suitable** for cc_executor's WebSocket-based command execution service.

## Key Findings

### 1. SDK Architecture
- The SDK is a Python wrapper around the Claude CLI
- It spawns the CLI as a subprocess internally
- It provides high-level abstractions for Claude conversations

### 2. Why the POC Failed
- The original POC used positional arguments instead of keyword arguments
- The SDK has async task cleanup issues (RuntimeError on exit)
- It successfully connects and receives messages but has lifecycle problems

### 3. SDK Limitations for cc_executor

| Feature | Subprocess (Current) | SDK | Winner |
|---------|---------------------|-----|---------|
| **Real-time streaming** | ✅ Full control over stdout/stderr | ❌ Abstracts away streams | Subprocess |
| **Process control** | ✅ SIGSTOP/SIGCONT/SIGTERM | ❌ No process access | Subprocess |
| **General commands** | ✅ Any command | ❌ Only Claude queries | Subprocess |
| **Environment control** | ✅ Full env manipulation | ❌ Hidden internally | Subprocess |
| **Timeout handling** | ✅ Custom timeouts | ❓ Unclear | Subprocess |
| **Error handling** | ✅ Direct access to exit codes | ❌ Abstracted | Subprocess |
| **WebSocket integration** | ✅ Direct stream piping | ❌ Would need adaptation | Subprocess |

### 4. SDK Advantages (not applicable to cc_executor)
- Simpler API for basic Claude conversations
- Structured message types
- Handles CLI connection management

### 5. Why Subprocess is Better for cc_executor

1. **cc_executor is not just for Claude** - It executes any command
2. **Real-time streaming is critical** - WebSocket clients need immediate output
3. **Process control is required** - Pause/resume/cancel functionality
4. **Direct stream access needed** - For progress tracking and buffering
5. **Environment manipulation** - Running hooks, setting up venvs, etc.

## Recommendation

**Keep the current subprocess implementation**. The SDK would:
- Add unnecessary abstraction layers
- Remove critical functionality (process control)
- Only work for Claude commands, not general execution
- Complicate WebSocket streaming
- Add dependency with potential breaking changes

The current subprocess approach in `process_manager.py` is well-designed for cc_executor's needs:
- Process group management
- Stream handling with deadlock prevention
- Signal-based control
- Environment setup
- Hook integration

## Code Quality Note

The current implementation shows deep understanding of:
- Async subprocess pitfalls (PYTHONUNBUFFERED, stdin deadlock)
- Process group management
- Stream buffering issues
- Graceful shutdown patterns

This is production-ready code that solves real problems the SDK doesn't address.
