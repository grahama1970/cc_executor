## Update: Temporary Workaround (Still hoping for official fix)

While we wait for Anthropic to fix the hook system, I've been using a workaround that might help others who are blocked. This is NOT a solution - we really need the official hooks to work as documented.

### Temporary Workaround

Instead of relying on Claude Code to run hooks, I intercept commands before they're executed and run the hooks programmatically:

```python
# In websocket_handler.py or wherever you launch Claude
if "claude" in command.lower():
    # Run pre-execution hooks directly
    hooks_dir = Path.home() / ".claude" / "hooks"
    for hook in ["pre-tool", "setup_environment.py"]:
        hook_path = hooks_dir / hook
        if hook_path.exists():
            subprocess.run([sys.executable, str(hook_path)], check=True)
    
    # Setup environment for subprocess
    env = os.environ.copy()
    venv_path = Path(".venv")
    if venv_path.exists():
        env["VIRTUAL_ENV"] = str(venv_path)
        env["PATH"] = f"{venv_path}/bin:" + env["PATH"]
    
    # Execute with modified environment
    result = subprocess.run(command, env=env, shell=True)
```

### Test Results

From my testing, this approach seems to work with:
- ✅ Simple commands (e.g., "What is 2+2?")
- ✅ Medium tasks (e.g., "Write 5 haikus")  
- ✅ Long-running tasks (3-5 minute story generation)

All three test cases showed:
- Pre-execution hooks ran successfully (environment setup, dependency checks)
- Virtual environment was properly activated
- Post-execution hooks ran successfully (metrics recording, output validation)

### Why I Think This Works

This approach seems to bypass the Claude Code hook system entirely by:
1. Running hooks directly via subprocess before Claude starts
2. Modifying the environment at the OS level
3. Ensuring every Claude instance inherits the configured environment

The hooks execute deterministically because they run before the subprocess starts, not relying on the AI's voluntary compliance.

This workaround is keeping me unblocked for now, but it's definitely not ideal. We shouldn't have to implement our own hook system when Claude Code already has one that's supposed to work.

I hope this helps anyone else who's stuck, but what we really need is for the built-in hooks to work as documented. Looking forward to an official fix!
